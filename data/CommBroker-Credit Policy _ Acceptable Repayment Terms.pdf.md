# Credit Policy | Acceptable Repayment Terms

Relates to the customer’s ability to make their loan repayments over the agreed term. It’s our responsibility to ensure customers are able to consistently service their loan repayments (principal plus interest) over the agreed period of time (term) without hardship.

# MAXIMUM OVERALL REPAYMENT TERMS

The maximum overall repayment terms, including an interest free period is:

|TYPE OF LOAN|MAX. INTEREST ONLY TERM (New and existing loan)|
|---|---|
|Home Loans|Five years|
|Investment Home Loans|Ten years (maximum of 5 years at a time)|
|Bridging Loans|One year|

Below are our maximum interest only terms by loan type. When doing the calculation just remember repayments are on a monthly amortised basis (except for bridging loans).

Here’s a good example: If an Investment Home Loan customer is eligible for a 30 year loan term and wants a 5 year interest only period, that’s okay -- provided the customer shows they can service the loan on a fully amortised basis over 25 years (i.e., the contracted loan term of 30 years minus the interest only period of 5 years).

Note: Interest only and fixed interest rate terms may differ (e.g. interest only term may be 5 years while interest rate is initially fixed for 3 years). Interest only terms are not available if the security is a leasehold estate.

# WHEN AN INTEREST ONLY PERIOD ENDS

When an interest only period ends, we’ll consider another interest only period if:

- The total interest only period for the life of the loan doesn’t exceed the maximum interest only term
- Capacity to repay is evident

# BRIDGING LOANS

Bridging loans help customers meet short term requirements if a repayment is reliant on the sale of an asset or an alternative income source. Bridging loans are limited to a maximum of one year in situations where:

- An interest servicing capacity is established
- A strong security position is available
- The existing property is sold within 12 months from funding date. The bridging debt must be repaid in full or reduced to the agreed residual debt level
