Customer Identification Check

Confirm a customer's identity by verifying their full name and residential address or date of birth captured in the Home Loan Application to acceptable documents listed on this page.

If the ID document is in a language you don't understand, it needs to have an English translation from either:

- A translator at the level of professional translator (or above) currently accredited by the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters Ltd (NAATI), or
- Another accredited or certified translator who currently holds an equivalent accreditation.

If the customer has limited English, engage an interpreter service to ensure the customer understands the information and consents they are required to provide.

If your customer uses Digital ID & On Boarding to set up their Netbank profile and verify their details, please continue to satisfy Identification and regulatory requirements for Mortgage transactions in line with the Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulatory requirements as well as indicating the Identification method used on the Home Loan on Boarding form Part D. Refer to the Digital ID & On Boarding section of this page for more information.

From 8 December 2022, the customer onboarding and identification process will have a new Digital ID & Onboarding option which can be completed prior to application submission – meaning faster processing times post submission.

Customers must meet the following eligibility criteria to use the Digital ID & Onboarding functionality:

- Over 18
- Have an Australian residential address
- Non Guarantor
- Cannot only have one name (eg. Only first name or only last name)
- Must have either Australian driver's license, Australian passport, Medicare card, or Australian Birth Certificate
- Cannot only have a foreign passport
- Have a smartphone with access to a mobile internet browser and valid phone number to receive SMS text messages

Note: Digital ID is currently only available in CommApply.

Digital ID & Onboarding – Customer Journey

Customer will be sent a link and verification code via SMS, and a second one-time passcode via SMS to authenticate their identity and access their digital ID & Onboarding details. Existing customers will be prompted to log into their Netbank to view the details their broker has entered.

- Once they have confirmed their details are correct the digital ID & Onboarding Process will be complete as they will have previously been identified by the bank.
- If details are incorrect customer will need to contact their broker or visit a Commonwealth Bank branch to correct their details.

New to Bank Customers will be able to view their details right away and confirm whether they are correct.

- If details are correct, the customer will then be prompted to set up a Netbank account by providing a password and a Netbank Client ID will be generated for them.
- The customer will then be asked to confirm their ID using ID documents and answer questions about ID, employment, and tax residency.
- If the customer does not wish to confirm ID digitally they are able to do this at a branch or with their broker.
- If customer details are incorrect – the customer will need to get in touch with their broker to have their details corrected in CommApply/ApplyOnline.
- Customer will not be able to use Digital ID and Onboarding, instead ID and onboarding processes will have to be completed manually as per current process.

Digital ID & Onboarding – Support

- To avoid any duplication or rework further in the application process, prior to submitting your customer’s application:
- Confirm all applicants have completed Digital ID & Onboarding processes prior to application submission
- Ensure any name discrepancies across customer ID have been addressed prior to submission and provide evidence of any change of names; to prevent application delays.
- Continue satisfying Identification requirements for Mortgage transactions in line with the Anti Money Laundering (AML) regulatory requirements as well as indicating the Identification method used on the Home Loan onboarding form Part D.

Please note that if the customer fails digital ID, Commonwealth bank will attempt to confirm their identity using the existing manual ID process – if this also fails, you will be contacted regarding next steps. Please speak to your relationship manager for more information or refer to the Digital ID & Onboarding Broker Guide for more information.
