# Credit Policy | Eligible and Excluded Borrowers

What Aside from helping customers make the right home lending decisions, we also need to consider each customer’s unique personal circumstances. This policy defines loan eligibility criteria for borrowers.

Why To manage expectations and avoid disappointment, it’s important we provide clarity around who is and who isn’t eligible for a loan.

*A owner occupied home loan may be offered to Trust borrowers where:

- The trustee will not claim any rental income, tax deductibility or negative gearing from the property being purchased; and
- The trustee is an individual and one or more of the beneficiaries will reside in the property on a permanent or periodic basis; or
- The trustee is a non-trading company and the beneficiaries are individuals, and one or more of the beneficiaries will reside in the property on a permanent or periodic basis

In all other scenarios an investment home loan must be offered. This includes where the borrower is an Australian registered non-trading company.

BORROWERS SUBMISSION OF OWN LOAN

CBA does not allow Brokers to originate their own applications. A broker cannot be a party to the transaction in any manner (eg. Joint borrower, applicant, guarantor, trustee, beneficiary, shareholder etc)

FAMILY AND FRIENDS

As a guiding principle, where there is a perceived or actual conflict of interest; transactions and interactions should be kept at arms-length; however, we understand that networking encompasses a multitude of social relationship types, including professional and personal relationships.

Brokers are to:

- Place their customer’s interests ahead of their own and are required to act in the best interest of the customer
- Give priority to the customers interest and must not prioritise their own interests

Brokers are permitted to submit applications for their family members, friends or acquaintances, as these relationships wouldn’t be seen to impact on a broker’s impartiality when dealing with their customer’s banking matters.
