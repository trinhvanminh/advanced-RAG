# About this policy

Definition of a commitment

A commitment is any regular repayment which a borrower or income guarantor (Spousal-Income Guarantee or Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee) may have. Commitments may be referred to as a debt, liability or facility which may be secured or unsecured. The commitment may vary from payment to payment, like the minimum payment on a credit card or be fixed at a nominated amount, for instance a personal loan repayment with a fixed interest rate.

Excludes items which are captured within Living Expenses policy.

Why this policy

This policy will help you in verifying existing commitments and repayment conduct.

This is a key part of the unsuitability assessment and is required for every applicant who is either a borrower or income-reliant guarantor.

Verification of the applicant's commitments ensures accurate information is used in completing a financial assessment and serviceability calculation.

Link to the original document

Repayment history on existing debts is considered to be a critical indicator of an applicant's credit worthiness and ability to meet commitments.

This policy is applicable where the loan activity is a:

- New loan application
- Loan increase
- Any loan variation activity requiring a serviceability assessment

You may also need to refer to other lending policy rules, including but not limited to:

- Serviceability assessment
- Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer
- Living expenses
- Document Standards

If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to Lenders Mortgage Insurance where required.

# 2. Rules you must apply

# 2.1 Policy exclusions

This policy does not apply to a Bridging ICAP loan without an end debt.

# 2.2 Customer commitments

To ensure we accurately assess our customer's financial position we need to:

- Collect information about their commitments.
- Verify the details of the commitment, refer to:

- Confirm the details of the commitment
- Financial hardship arrangement check and evidence satisfactory repayment history

# 2.3 Conflicting information

Further investigation may be required if we have identified any conflicts between any information (including Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) data where applicable) and other supporting documents provided by the applicant. Refer to Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer

In addition to the Commitments policy requirements, Brokers are reminded to complete the scrutiny activity as outlined in Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer

# Business commitments

Where a business commitment is:

- Held in a personal name, is not declared as a personal liability
- Has been verified as accounted for in the entity tax returns / financials and
- Has been included with the self-employed income assessment in the Broker Serviceability Calculator (for a partnership, company or trust)

This is not to be considered an undeclared liability or a CCR mismatch.

Where the self-employed entity is a sole trader

- The commitment must be included as a personal liability of the individual (within OBP / ApplyOnline)

Note: Post Unconditional approval, account / Bpay details may be required if they aren't included in the documents used for verification of the commitment, in order to make the payment into any liabilities being cleared and closed or reduced using loan funds.

Refinance is where some or all of the loan funds are being advanced to repay and refinance debts currently with Westpac (WBC), St George Bank Group and/or other financial institutions. This may involve a new loan or could include an increase on an existing loan to repay other debts, i.e. where an existing debt is being:

2.5 Financial hardship arrangement check and evidence satisfactory repayment history

|Verification task|Additional information|
|---|---|
|Financial hardship arrangement check|Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship arrangements|

You are required to manually obtain and review the PDF version of the CCR bureau report to identify if the customer is specifically in temporary relief or has a deferral financial hardship arrangement in place and they are operating within the agreed arrangements.

Where a borrower is experiencing difficulty paying their current commitments, they may enter into formal financial hardship arrangements with a credit or finance provider. Poor conduct may occur even where such arrangements are in place.

Identifying and reviewing performance of formal financial hardship arrangements applies to active commitments held by borrowers and / or income guarantors (WBC only) which are listed on the CCR bureau report.

Source: https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000690

This check is not required where policy does not require a CCR to be generated. E.g. for a loan variation activity where no CCR is required to be generated.

The ‘financial hardship arrangement check’ policy applies to commitments held with both the Westpac Group or external parties for each commitment type which appears on the CCR and tells us how to complete a financial hardship arrangement check.

An application where a borrower and / or income guarantors are in temporary relief or a deferral financial hardship arrangement is in place may be referred to Credit for consideration if mitigants and additional supporting documents are provided. For example, details of the formal financial hardship arrangement.

‘Evidence satisfactory repayment history’ is a separate verification activity. You must also comply with the associated rules below.

Evidence satisfactory repayment history

A review of historical account conduct forms a key component of the Westpac unsuitability assessment.

Unsatisfactory conduct can be a sign an applicant is experiencing hardship in managing their current debt commitments.

Verification of conduct applies to active commitments held by borrowers and/or income guarantors (WBC only).

If the commitment has been operating for less than the specified time frame, conduct is to be assessed from the date the commitment was established.

The 'Evidence satisfactory repayment history' check policy applies to commitments held with both the Westpac Group or external parties for each commitment type and tells us:

- when and how to complete a repayment history check
- what represents 'satisfactory' repayment history
- the time period we need to review

You will need to refer to the 'Not on CCR - Verifying repayment history when not using CCR' rules where any of the below apply:

- the commitment is not displayed on the CCR
- repayment history demonstrated on CCR is blank
- a commitment has recently been approved but is not yet open or has been open for less than 1 month
- policy specifies that the 'Not on CCR' process / policy is to be followed
- policy does not require a CCR to be generated - e.g. for a loan variation activity where no CCR is generated

Does not apply where the commitment is a mortgage that has been negatively geared or where an interest deduction (for the specific debt) is being applied to the serviceability calculation. Including when the commitment is a company commitment or a trust with corporate trustee. In these scenarios the actual interest rate on the supporting document must be the same as the value entered in the assessment system to ensure we accurately reflect the negative gearing / interest deduction.

The supporting document evidences a principal and interest (P&I) repayment method but an interest only (I/O) remaining term has been included in the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation.

The supporting document evidences an interest only (I/O) remaining term and/or total remaining term which differs to the value included in the assessment system / used for the monthly repayment calculation. The difference must be less than or equal to two months.

The supporting document evidences a lower minimum payment than the value entered in the assessment system.

# Time Frame / Age of document definition

When calculating if the document meets the required timeframe or age of document requirements the following definitions are to be used:

- The definition of 1 month is:
- The first day of the month up to and including the last day of the same month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 31/1/2018) or
- Any day in the first month up to and including one day prior in the next month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/2/2018)
- The definition of 2 months is:
- The first day of month up to and including the last day of the following month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 28/2/2018) or
- Any day in the first (given) month up to and including one day prior in the following second month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/3/2018)

The same methodology may be extrapolated out to any higher number of months.

# Not on CCR - Verifying repayment history when not using CCR

Supporting documents must be obtained:

- Where a commitment is not yet open or has been open for less than 1 month to confirm repayments are not due yet*; or
- To establish repayment history where the commitment is on CCR but the current, 2nd and 3rd months display all R and / or P special values and repayment history cannot be established using CCR alone.
- Where the commitment type is not displayed on the Comprehensive Credit Report (CCR), and:
- Adverse conduct is evidenced on other commitments, and
- The liability or commitment is not exempt from financial hardship arrangement checks or conduct checks.

WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

No further repayment history checks (or financial hardship arrangement checks) are required where the supporting document confirms the first payment date has not yet fallen due, refer Acceptable Documents > commitment type > Commitment recently approved or established.

Note:

If the commitment has been operating for less than the specified time frame, conduct is to be assessed from the date the commitment was established

|Commitment type|Repayment history is considered unsatisfactory when:|What do I need to do?|
|---|---|---|
|"Buy Now Pay Later" Commitment from providers:|Supporting document shows evidence of direct debit/s to the provider which are returned / reversed / dishonoured / rejected|In all cases where unsatisfactory conduct is evident: the balance of the facility is to be verified (if the application is to proceed). Note: You may need to obtain an additional supporting document to verify the balance. Refer to Acceptable documents > commitment type table|
|For all other commitment types|Supporting document shows evidence of: Arrears (may be in the form of statement messages, late fees, legal fees, default interest, etc.) Cheque dishonours Payment reversals Overdue payments Limit exceeded or over limit fees being charged|If the most recent account balance evidenced is > the commitment limit, then: The most recent account balance is to be updated in the origination platform; and Serviceability is to be assessed using the most recent balance (where applicable for debts that use the higher of either the balance or limit for serviceability assessment.) Refer to Serviceability Assessment > Commitments > Serviceability repayment amount > Type of commitment Also see: Document Standards: Minimum Document Standards Age of documents|

|Question|Answer|
|---|---|
|Are regular Chrisco payments (and other similar hamper scheme arrangements) to be captured as a living expense or a commitment?|Capture as an expense.|
|How do I know if a card needs to be repaid in full each month?|If the minimum payment due is equal to the closing balance, the card must be paid in full.|
|Are Layby payments to be captured as a living expense or a commitment?|Capture as an expense. They are different from a credit card and short term buy now pay later schemes as you have to pay for your goods in full before you receive them. Note: There is also a 'Buy Now Pay Later' facility named "Laybuy" which needs to be loaded as a commitment (not an expense).|
|When using an account statement for verification, do I need every page issued for that statement?|You only need the pages which: Display the information you are verifying, and Enable you to comply with the Minimum Document Standards for an account statement.|
|If a tax bill was due prior to the Responsible Lending Start Date, do I need to ask the customer if the bill was paid or provide evidence that it was paid?|There is no requirement to make enquiries about or evidence payment of that bill, unless other application information suggests that the payment was not made (i.e the Tax bill has become a Tax debt)|
|My customer pre-pays tax expected to be payable for the current tax year. E.g. they make PAYG Instalments. Do I need to include this as a Tax Debt?|No. Pre-payment of tax is not considered to be a tax debt|
|The customer has advised that they don't have a tax bill or tax debt overdue. Do I need to undertake further enquiries or verification activity?|There is no requirement to undertake further verification or evidence the current status of the customer's tax payments, unless other application information suggests that the payment was not made (i.e the Tax bill has become a Tax debt)|

Chrisco and other hamper schemes are like a lay-buy as you have to buy your goods before you get them and can cancel the order. In that way they are different from a credit card and buy now pay later schemes like AfterPay and ZipPay.

No, you may use a combination of documents, provided pe documents or systems used fulfil pe policy requirements.

Do I always need to get a statement to verify the details of the commitment and the repayment history of the account?

What happens if a commitment has been closed, but the customer is still repaying the account?

I noticed that prior to this loan application the customer had been making payments to a credit card which has not been declared. The customer advised me that the card was closed prior to this loan application. The Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) does not display the card as active, and I can't see any payments being made to the card after this loan application. Do I need the customer to provide evidence that the card has been closed?

How can the Bank generate a refreshed Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) to evidence that a commitment previously on the report is now closed or has been changed (e.g. the limit has been reduced)?

The Comprehensive Credit Bureau Report (CCR) shows an existing loan facility held jointly by the borrowers on the loan being processed. Do I have to load this existing loan against each borrower in ApplyOnline?

|Yes.|The existing loan commitment must be included in the serviceability assessment; this must be apportioned against all relevant borrowers.|
|---|---|
|Automated system rules control when the CCR is refreshed. We are unable to refresh the CCR outside of these controls. An alternate supporting document will be required to evidence the updated commitment position (closure, limit reduction etc.) if the CCR generated by the system does not reflect the closure/change| |
|No.|The customer has confirmed that the commitment was not in place at the time of the loan application and there is nothing to indicate a conflict with this information. As such, you may accept the customer's explanation and do not need to obtain evidence of closure. Ensure you record the details of your discussion in application comments.|

As an example this could occur where: the customer has voluntarily cancelled a credit card but is still paying back the debt or where the credit card has been revoked and limit cancelled by the card issuer due to poor conduct. You need to need to verify the details of the commitment and include the repayment for serviceability calculations. For example, if policy requires that you verify : 1) Loan Limit: 2) Loan Interest Rate 3) Loan Balance 4) Repayment history

If the Comprehensive Credit Report (CCR) provides the limit and repayment history only, a second document will be required to confirm the interest rate and the balance. If the information you need (2 and 3) is contained on an 'account summary/extract/overview' (or any other allowable document), policy has been satisfied and an account statement (or any other document) is not required
