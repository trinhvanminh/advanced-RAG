- Create a PDF copy of the employer income calculator outcome and retain the PDF in the file.
- If a loan application is referred to Credit a copy of the calculation must be available with the loan documentation for reference.

Pre-Tax deduction Note: If the salary sacrifice deduction is not required to be included in gross income for serviceability calculations, it is acceptable to proceed with the lower income figure.

In these instances you must still include any commitment or living expense which is related to the deduction amount.

Also see:

Verifying

- Complete the fields within the employer income calculator tool as per the specific income scenario until you reach the "Salary Sacrifice" fields, then refer to below for individual deduction type:

For Additional Superannuation Contributions Steps

1. Review the payslip and identify the Superannuation Guarantee (SG) contribution amount and the voluntary additional superannuation contribution. If the payslip only shows a single superannuation deduction, then further investigation is required. If it is identified that the superannuation deduction relates solely to the SG amount, then do not proceed further. Where you have confirmed the deduction is a voluntary superannuation contribution, proceed to step 2.
2. Have the applicant complete the Salary Sacrifice Declaration form. Check the form has been completed in line with requirements as per Rules &gt; Pre-tax deductions

Notes: You cannot use the salary sacrificed income for serviceability calculations if the applicant has not:

- indicated the deduction is voluntary (i.e. because it relates to a compulsory super contribution); and
- indicated the deduction can be cancelled at any time and received as taxable income; and
- confirmed (where policy requires this declaration) that they would cancel the deduction if required to meet their existing commitments and the repayments for the loan they have requested.

In the employer income calculator, ensure you complete the fields:

- Pre-tax deductions required for servicing? Yes / No
- Pre-tax deduction &gt; Input the actual amount from the payslip. (The amount field must be completed even where the income is not used for serviceability assessment)

Note: The salary sacrifice (pre-tax deduction) amount loaded must be &gt;=$0. All salary sacrifice fields displayed are to be completed. For example, where more than single years documents are obtained complete both the Current Year and Prior Year columns. Where there has been a change to base income, the pre-tax deduction amount prior to the base increase must also be entered. The salary sacrifice amount can vary depending on the applicant's salary

WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

Steps for Salary Sacrifice Arrangements:

1. Have the applicant complete the Salary Sacrifice Declaration form. Check the form for completeness.
2. Ensure the following fields are completed in the employer income calculator:
- Pre-tax deductions required for servicing? Yes / No
- Pre-tax deduction > Input the actual amount from the payslip.
3. The calculator will determine the gross base and non-base income amounts for ApplyOnline.
4. Create a PDF copy of the employer income calculator outcome and retain it in the file. Complete ApplyOnline notes with a clear explanation of the income.

Additional Guidelines:

1. If a PAYG Payment Summary or ATO Income Statement is needed, "Reportable employer superannuation contributions" may be added to "Gross payments."
2. Ensure the salary sacrifice amount is >=$0 and complete all salary sacrifice fields in the calculator.
3. For Purchased leave and other purposes, follow the specified steps.

Documentation:

- Assessment notes should explain the income used for serviceability assessment.
- A copy of the calculation must be available with the loan documentation if referred to Credit.

5. If a loan application is referred to Credit a copy of the calculation must be available with the loan documentation for reference.

6. Any corresponding debt / commitment that relates to the salary sacrifice amount must be included in ApplyOnline

7. For car lease payments only the finance portion of the car lease is to be included as an outgo in ApplyOnline (i.e. the car running costs are to be included the declared Living Expenses and do not need to be included as an outgo).

Note:

Often a novated lease may not be cancelled and taken as an increase in gross taxable income due to the potential financial implications to the customer.

Salary sacrifice may be linked to an expense. Ensure the expense is included in customer declared expenses where appropriate e.g. transport in customer declared expense, or car loan repayments in liabilities refer Living expenses.

3.2 Assessing Base plus Non-Base income

Be aware YTD income figures on a payslip may be provided as YTD total gross earnings (being income prior to tax or other pre-tax deductions) or YTD total taxable earnings (being after pre-tax deductions).

- Employer income calculator will annualize income over a 48-week period (i.e. allowing 2 weeks leave and 2 weeks sick leave annually). In some scenarios e.g. casual teachers or other school staff, income should be annualized over less than a 48-week period, i.e. over 40 weeks. Ensure correct "weeks to annualize" is selected in the calculator.
