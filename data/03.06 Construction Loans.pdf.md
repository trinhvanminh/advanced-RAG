1. About this policy

1.1 Why this policy?

Purpose A construction loan, also known as a building loan or a TBE (To-Be-Erected) loan, is a specialised lending option that provides a borrower and their builder, funding throughout the process of constructing or renovating a property.

This policy identifies the structure required for a home loan where the borrowers would like to use the funds for residential building purposes.

The loan proceeds can be used to fund the construction of one or more residential dwellings (subject to Acceptable Security Collateral) or undertake home improvements (renovations) to an already established property, where the property is also security for the proposed loan.

|Contract only|upgrades are made with the build contract price increased then the customers must ensure that they have access to sufficient funds to pay for the increase. For example the customer has sufficient savings or an approved increase in lending. down-grades are made with the layout or finish changing including quality of fixtures and fittings changing or the build contract cost reducing, then the customers must notify the Bank as the variations to the contract may impact the valuation of the property. For example original building contract included ducted air-conditioning and the customers ask the builder to not proceed with purchase and installation of the air-conditioning|
|---|---|
|Funding in advance is not available. Funds are released against the cost to complete as advised by the Bank’s panel valuer. Release of funds is based on the items being affixed to the site. E.g. The borrower wishes to purchase the bricks ready to construct the walls. Payment can only be made after the bricks are affixed in place. For any variation to cost estimates after the Loan’s first advance, borrower/s should ensure they have sufficient funds to cover the difference from the original contract (where there is an increase in costs to construct) The panel valuer may request additional documentation to support the 'Construction' valuation and this will be set out in the valuation report. This may include: a Quantity Surveyor (QS) reports Engineer's details re slab / footings Pest treatment or pest prevention confirmation Roof truss details from manufacturer| |
|For Owner Builders only for properties located in NSW:|Before the final progress payment the Bank requires a copy of the updated Survey Report showing the position of the improvements in relation to the boundaries, and that all improvements comply with the Local Government Ordinances (The survey should be updated after completion of eaves and guttering) or a copy of the Certificate of Occupancy. Prior to the first progress payment the Bank may request to sight the survey report showing the location of the footings / slab (or the pegged out survey) In all cases the Broker is to ascertain the borrower/s experience and background to undertake the construction and provide notes in their submission accordingly. Lender/Broker is to comment on any large variations between Owner Builder cost estimate and Panel Valuer check costs shown on the valuation report. Check costs are the Valuer's estimates of the cost of the project under contract builder conditions. There should be a demonstrable cost benefit for the Owner builder project v's completing the transaction via a Licensed builder.|
|For Kit Home applications|the Bank will not advance any funds for purchase or delivery of the kit against value of the (unassembled) kit or, offsite construction costs.|
|Unacceptable Building Types|Split Contract constructions (both single residential and multi-unit residential developments) are not permitted. Kit homes where funding of the kit is required up front or prior to installation Transportable homes where funding of the dwelling is required prior to the dwelling being transported, fixed on site, and all services connected. Owner builder loans where funding are in advance (refer Owner Builder) Any home proposed to be built from unconventional building materials. Example Mud Brick, straw bale, polystyrene, log cabin. Refer to Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) and the Acceptable Security Collateral policies for further information.|

# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

|Acceptable Building Types|Definition|
|---|---|
|Licensed Builder - Fixed Price Contract|A fixed price contract is where the customer and the Licensed Builder agree to a set price for the cost of building a home or undertaking renovations prior to commencing any building work.|
|Licensed Builder Cost - Plus (Non-fixed price) contract|Cost plus contracts can be identified because they do not state the total cost of the build and may only provide a 'budgeted cost to complete', 'Cost plus a percentage' or may show the cost of the works plus allow a margin for labour or even building material cost increases. The amount due to the builder is the actual cost incurred by the contractor plus a percentage or the cost incurred plus an hourly rate for the contractor. As materials are not a fixed price, the overall cost of the contract can vary. This can result in a significant increase in the contract price prior to/or during construction and therefore may adversely affect the Bank's lending and security position.|
|Owner Builder|The Bank will treat the following application and borrower types as Owner Builders: Anyone who takes on the responsibility of managing their own residential building project. This includes where the borrower(s) takes on the tasks of coordinating and contracting roles usually undertaken by an architect or builder, regardless if they do or do not hold qualifications in the building industry or related trades (e.g. electrician, plumber). Any portion of the construction is carried out by the owner. The borrower(s) are Directors / Proprietors of the entity undertaking the construction. Exception: If the entity is a Pty Ltd company (PLC) and, there is a standard fixed price building contract between PLC as the builder and the borrower as the customer, refer to Licensed builder fixed price contract or Licensed builder Cost-plus contract. Kit Homes (even where the construction is completed by an unrelated licensed builder contract).|
|Renovation / Home Improvement loans|A renovation to an established residential property can be completed by way of a Licensed Builder, Owner Builder or using multiple external tradespeople and will be assessed according to builder type and value of construction. In some cases we may be able to release equity against the current value of an existing property, refer to 'Progress payments not required' for eligibility criteria.|
|Kit Homes|A construction option wherein most of the components of the home are prefabricated and are brought to the site / location of construction where it is assembled. A Kit Home can be either: Wholly or partially constructed offsite (i.e. in manufacturer's premises to a specific stage) then delivered to borrower's land for affixing to the borrower's land.|

# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

All building materials necessary to construct the home are delivered to the borrower’s land for constructing on site.

# Multiple Dwellings

Residential building loans where more than one dwelling is being constructed i.e. duplex, townhouses or units are considered to be multiple dwelling developments.

# Transportable Homes

|A dwelling transported to site and permanently affixed in place.|Require connection to services (e.g. water, gas, electricity, sewerage).|
|---|---|
|Is not able to be easily moved again.|Is not to be confused with a relocatable home, which is not acceptable for bank lending purposes.|

# Standard House / Land Package

Borrowers choose a block of land and house from a range of building plan options offered by the builder. Borrowers may have a choice of builders if the land is being purchased from a developer. The builder may be completing additional items like air-conditioning, carpeting, landscaping etc. When determining the market value on a 'To be Erected (TBE)' basis, the valuation will reflect separate values for the land and improvements.

# House / Land Package

With a "Turn Key" style house and land package the property is purchased as one parcel and contracts can be entered into for the purchase either on completion of the home before construction commences or once construction is complete. The borrower is not able to choose their own builder and settlement does not take place until after completion of construction.

Additional building work outside of the primary builder's fixed price contract

A Licensed Builder's fixed price contract may incorporate the completion of all required building work. However, it is acceptable for the applicant to provide separate contracts or quotes for additional work to be completed as a part of the

# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

If these works are being funded by the Bank and the valuer has considered these improvements when arriving at a 'TBE' (To Be Erected) valuation figure of the property, the Bank must control funds to ensure this work is completed.

The following items are examples of additional works which may be completed by an external contractor other than the primary builder:

- Air conditioning
- Carpets
- Curtains
- Driveways
- Fences
- Flooring
- Landscaping
- Paving
- Pergolas
- Security System
- Swimming Pool
- Window furnishing

External Tradespeople quotes above fixed price build contract or renovations using multiple builders or contractors:

A maximum of 5 quotes can be accepted without referral to Credit, where the applicant:

- Has a fixed price contact with a single licensed builder to manage the construction or renovation, and
- The construction or renovation is less than or equal to $1m*, and
- External tradespeople / contractors are used for additional work outside of the fixed price contract

OR

Is sourcing individual tradespeople to complete renovations rather than engaging a single builder to manage renovations.

*For fixed price contract greater than $1m, there is no limit to the maximum number of quotes as each progress payment (including quotes) requires a progress inspection, refer Progress Inspections

Note: If more than 5 quotes the application is to be referred to Credit to consider any additional requirements (e.g. treat as owner builder in terms of this policy).

For further requirements refer to:

- Process > Renovation / Home Improvement loans using 'Construction' valuation
- Process > Construction loans using 'Construction' valuation where there is additional building work outside of builder's fixed price contract

2.7 Borrower's contribution

Before utilising any loan proceeds for progress payments, the borrower’s contribution must be fully utilised
(or allocated) to the Construction stage.

For OBP Applications, where either :

1. The Application involves a single loan for both land purchase/refinance AND construction with progress payments or;
2. The Application comprises separate loans, where the first is for land purchase/refinance and the second is for construction with progress payments;

then the borrower’s contribution for the initial land settlement will be utilised based on Application Loan To Value Ratio (LVR)*. Subsequently, the remaining portion of the borrower’s contribution will be entirely used for the construction loan before initiating loan proceeds for progress payments.

Owner Builder                                     Transportable                                  All Other

Funding in advance is not available.
The Bank will not advance funds for
work yet to be completed but will
only reimburse Owner Builders for
work completed. This means                                                                       Where the loan amount applied for /

funds to allow them to cover the                  contribution, consider the                     costs/tender (including quotes),
most expensive stage of                           difference between the loan                    borrowers will be required to have the
construction.                                     amount and costs related to the                difference between the tender /
purchase of the 'house'. For a                 transportable this may also                    contract and loan amount available in a
transportable this may also                    include the costs of                           savings account, prior to or concurrent
transportation, transit insurance              and site fixing.

The cost of the most expensive                    stage may be greater than the                     difference between the Owner                      Builder cash flow statement and                   loan amount. Evidence of Borrower
contribution held in a savings
account is required prior to the
Bank issuing a Builders Pack.

Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral
When a shortfall is identified by the Progress Payments Team, the Lender/Broker will be advised and are required to
address before loan funds can be drawn. The calculation used to identify a shortfall is as follows:

https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000688                                                                                    13/26

Borrower’s Contribution + Loan Amount (less any fees) is less than the Building Price. The Building price includes the contract plus any additional quotes used to achieve the ‘To Be Erected (TBE)’ valuation figure.

Following this assessment of the borrower/s’ position, the Broker must notify the Progress Payments team of the outcome, so that an amended schedule can be issued.

Changes to council approved or privately certified plans
Before pe borrower makes any changes to council approved plans, pey must inform pe Bank and obtain consent. If pere are changes, such as to pe structure or pe projected costing, details must be provided in writing.
A Construction Valuation (short form or long form) is required to confirm pe property's value against pe new (amended) Council Approved Plans and Specifications.
Subject to pe nature of pe change pe application may need to be re-assessed and a new approval issued (including new loan offer documents and progress payment schedules). The re-assessment is required to ensure pe transaction, security and resulting LVR remain acceptable to pe Bank.

|Conditions|All required documentation is to be received by the Bank at the appropriate stages for the loan and progress payments to be drawn. Any shortfall of funds (Insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral) will require Lender/Broker follow up. The Lender/Broker will need to evidence the borrower has sufficient funds to complete and send a confirmation email to the Progress Payments Team. The Progress Payments Team must have issued a Builders Pack. This occurs once the certificate of title has been certified, settlement requirements have been met and there is no evidence of shortfall.|
|Every time a progress payment is requested|If LVR is less than 80% - at practical completion is required If LVR is equal to or greater than 80% - 1st at frame stage, 2nd at practical completion|

A Progress Inspection Report may be requested from the original valuer. Refer to Progress Inspections Process: Refer to Process &gt; Progress Payments.

Owner Builder progress payment stages are not pre-determined.

When the borrower requests a progress payment, an inspection by the Bank's panel valuer is required to determine the value of the work completed to date, prior to any payment being released.

At all times, sufficient loan funds are retained to ensure practical completion of the dwelling based on the owner builder's original cost to complete and valuer's assessment of completed work.

Assessment is based only on works completed / materials fixed to site, and not materials purchased or delivered to site. For example, the Owner Builder may have just completed the pouring of the slab and request the first progress payment. In addition, they have purchased the bricks and roof tiles and had them delivered to the construction site. The Bank will only reimburse the customer for the slab because the bricks and roof tiles have not been installed and are not fixed to the site.

Owner Builder
Progress payment schedules are considered to be 'Standard' where pe valuer makes a comment wipin pe valuation commentary to indicate pey are 'to industry standard', or makes no comment.

If the valuer comments the schedule of payments are 'not to industry standard', then you must request a new schedule of payments from the Builder when the below conditions apply:

- The schedule already held does not meet the table 1 below and:
- The application is Mortgage Insured; or
- The application is Non-mortgage insured loan with any risk rating ≥ 4

No action is required when the valuer comments 'not to industry standard' but the above conditions are not triggered.

When required to obtain a new schedule of payments, all of the below applies:

- They must correspond with the completion basic stages of construction, which can be:
- Deposit
- Foundations
- Frame
- External Lining
- Lockup / Internal Lining
- Practical Completion

Licensed Builder contracts – Non-Standard
The schedule of payments must comply wip pe below table:

|Progress Payment Stage|% of Contract|
|---|---|
|Maximum at Foundation Stage (including deposit)|20|
|Minimum at Practical Completion Stage|10|
|Other individual stages limited to|≤ 35|
|All Stages must total|100|

The above table ensures that a builder allocates the appropriate level of funds at each stage of the build, ensuring the construction is completed.

The application must not proceed to formal approval until a compliant schedule of payments is held.

- the ‘Progress Payments not required’ table below for maximum loan amounts and any additional requirements.
- Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) policy for Maximum LVR
- Glossary for definition of ‘as is’ valuation

Brokers and Assessors are required to identify and record the purpose of all loan funds, refer Eligibility &gt; Suitability Assessment under Responsible Lending. The residential property improvement amount is to be reflected in ApplyOnline.

2.12 Quantity Surveyor (QS) Report

A professional who specialises in the field of construction and property development, with the primary responsibility to accurately estimate the costs associated with construction projects, from the initial planning stages to the final completion.

Definition of a QS

When is a QS report

For all Acceptable Building Types, the Valuer at their discretion may request a QS report. Note: when the valuer has requested a QS report, this cannot be waived.

WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

Common instances when pis may occur include (but are not limited to):
- Owner builder constructions
- Building sites wip complexities (e.g., site access complication, steeply sloping environmental issues / flooding).
- High build cost per square metre
- Building contracts wip non-industry standard progress schedules e.g.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A progress schedule pat is time based (e.g., monply payments to pe builder pat do not relate to work completed)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A progress schedule pat requires payments to be paid, for partially completed works / stages.
- Constructions wip unusual designs (e.g. where valuer has few peers in pe building market to draw reasonable rate cost conclusions). For furper information as to what is considered 'unusual' refer to Assessing Security Collateral &gt; rules you must apply &gt; Assessing security requirements - standard real estate &gt; Residential dwelling to be erected.

Who pays for a QS report?

A QS is to be engaged and paid for by pe borrower/s in all instances. This includes pe QS report at pe initial TBE Valuation and at all Progress Inspection stages.
The QS engaged by pe borrower/s must be a member of Australian Institute of Quantity Surveyors.
Whenever a progress payment is requested, if pe valuer requires a QS report, pe customer must provide pis to pe bank.

Conditions

A QS Report must include:
- The cost benefit of completing pe construction on an owner builder basis.
- The total cost to complete pe project.
The site stages must add up to pe total cost of pe project.
The QS Report provided at progress inspections is to cover:
- Evidence pat work completed is according to industry standards.
- Cost of work completed to date.
- A comparison wip original costing.
When pe QS report has been provided, pe broker / assessor must archive a copy wip pe loan file and provide a copy to pe valuer.
If Mortgage Operations identifies pat pe cost to complete pe project on pe QS report exceeds pe building contract or remaining undrawn loan balance, pe application will be referred to pe Broker to confirm how any additional costs will be met. Refer to insufficient building funds (shortfall) to complete security collateral.

Settlement period - building loans

'Settlement' for all building loans is defined as the first draw down (i.e. for land settlement) or where no initial draw is to occur, satisfactory completion of all the Bank's legal requirements to register a mortgage over the land and funds are ready to be made available.

For Construction Loans (Contract Builder/Owner Builder):

Initial draw down is to occur wipin 12 monps of pe Loan offer date and;
