Determine when income generated from the property is to be considered for servicing purposes

Note: Income generated from the property which is used for servicing purposes must be from the customer’s own business/es.

|Security type|Rental income|Income generated from the property|Apply net losses|
|---|---|---|---|
|New/Purchase property|Yes|No*|No*|
|Existing/proposed property where the applicant has generated income|Yes|Yes**|Yes|

*where the business has been run by the applicants who are now looking to purchase the property. In this scenario, where the property has recorded a net loss, the loss would have to be included in the application.

**Where the customer confirms their intention is to continue the income generating activity attached to the land.

The income used for servicing purposes must be the net profit/loss position (i.e. after expenses). To determine the net profit/loss position, follow the Self-Employed (full verification) process.

It is not always necessary to utilise the net profit generated from the property for servicing purposes however where there is a net loss recorded in the applicant’s financials, the loss must always be recorded.

| |Example 1|Example 2|
|---|---|---|
|Income – PAYG|$100,000|$100,000|
|Property Income (NPBT + Addbacks)| | |
|Income for servicing|$108,000|$95,000|
