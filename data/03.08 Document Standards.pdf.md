Self-employed Customers

Verifying income

Loan Application and Approval &gt; Validation of information provided by the customer

Specific policy chapters will detail any additional requirements for the document type.

All supporting documents provided to the bank containing Tax file numbers must be redacted before being uploaded to ApplyOnline or imaged and held on the loan file (e.g. for non-ApplyOnline loan variations)

Note: Mortgage Insurers and Credit may also request additional requirements above the minimum standards

2.2 Maximum age of documents

'Maximum Age' refers to the maximum period that can elapse between the date the document was produced to the ‘Responsible Lending Start Date’. Refer to Loan Application and Approval &gt; Responsible Lending Start Date.

Refer to the Minimum Document Standards Table to determine the maximum allowable age for a document.

Where a series of documents is required (e.g. 2 payslips) the most recent is to be dated within the limit described in Maximum age

|Maximum Age|Definition|
|---|---|
|1 Month|The first day of the month up to and including the last day of the same month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 31/1/2018) or Any day in the first month up to and including one day prior in the next month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/2/2018)|
|2 Months|The first day of the month up to and including the last day of the following month (e.g. 1/1/2018 to 28/2/2018) or Any day in the first (given) month up to and including one day prior in the following second month (e.g. 15/1/2018 to 14/3/2018)|

The same methodology may be extrapolated out to any higher number of months

# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

Internally supplied

Refer to the Minimum Document Standards Table to determine:

- The acceptable document format for each document type
- The acceptable supplier for each document type

2.4 Using a combination of documents to complete verification

It is acceptable to use either a single supporting document, or a combination of documents to complete verification activities for the following policies:

- Verifying Income
- Commitments *

* Note: Includes the following non-discretionary expense types:

- Outgoing child support (maintenance) payments
- Outgoing alimony (spousal support)
- Outgoing rent

Where a combination of documents is used, a document override code will not be required to be entered where the below are met:

- A clear link can be established between each document provided (e.g. account number matched on each document); and
- The combined documents display all of the mandatory to verify requirements as specified for the verification activity being completed and documented in:

Verifying Income

Commitments

Minimum Document Standards Table

Where policy requires the verification document to include both the account holder name and account number / identifier, and the primary document does not display both, then a second verification document is required to link the primary document to the applicant. The maximum age of the ‘linking’ document is 12 months from the Responsible Lending start date.

Examples of acceptable document combinations include, but are not limited to the following:

- Commitment verification – a transaction summary is provided which displays the account number but not the account holder’s name. If used in isolation, the transaction summary does not meet document standards. A second supporting document, such as an account statement (that may not meet the maximum age of document requirements for that document) may be obtained to connect the transaction summary to the applicant.
- Income verification –

Where the combination of documents supplied do not include all of the mandatory

# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

Information required to enable the verification activity to be completed, lenders / assessors must obtain an alternate acceptable document.

If no other acceptable document is available, the broker / assessor may refer the application to Credit for consideration, where supported by strong mitigants and justification within application comments.

2.5 When supporting documents are not in English or display a currency other than AUD

In all cases where the supporting documents are not in English or a currency other than Australian dollars (AUD) is displayed on the document, the Foreign currency translation checklist is to be completed.

Where the supporting documents are in a language other than English:

- The applicant is to supply both the original document and an English translation prepared by an accredited translator at their own cost.
- The translated document is to be stamped with the translator's NAATI stamp.

Translation of documents by either a Westpac Group staff member or a Westpac Group Finance Broker is not permitted. Refer https://www.naati.com.au/# for a list of translators in your local area (click on the "online directory").

2.6 Name variations

The names of borrowers and guarantors must be correct in ApplyOnline.

Where a verification document(s) shows a name mismatch to the loan origination system, policy allows minor name variations to be accepted without referring to Credit or applying an override.

The tables below list a number of acceptable name variation scenarios / examples and are intended as a guide only, i.e. they should not be taken as the only allowable scenarios / examples.

| | |The names of borrowers and guarantors must be correct in the loan origination system.|

| | |Name variation acceptable under policy - without further verification|
| | |Scenario / example|Requirements to be acceptable under policy|
| | |Borrower / guarantors name not shown in full| |
| | |E.g. Middle names missing| |
| | |Verification document shows Jane Doe| |
| | |Correct name in origination system is Jane Anne Doe| |
