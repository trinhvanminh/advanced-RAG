# Calculations

Note: The calculated amount of bonus must be entered into the 'Bonus' income field within the application and the system will automatically apply 80% for servicing.

Option 1 or 2
Use the average of the two year's bonus amount for servicing
Example of where the Most Recent Financial Year (MRFY) is higher compared to Previous Financial Year (PFY):
MRFY $100,000 + PFY $10,000 = $110,000
Average is $110,000 / 2 = $55,000 p.a.
Example of where the MRFY is lower compared to PFY:
MRFY $10,000 + PFY $40,000 = $50,000
Average is $50,000 / 2 = $25,000 p.a.

# Other/Special Notes:
