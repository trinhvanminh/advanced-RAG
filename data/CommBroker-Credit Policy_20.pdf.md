# Credit Policy

Eligible Income

PAYG Law, Accounting and/or Consulting Firm Partner Income

Partner income received from a law, accounting and/or consulting firm. Typically, there are two types of partners in a firm: equity partners and salaried partners.

- Equity partners are defined as those who have ownership interest in the partnership.
- Salaried partners are those who have not invested directly in the business financially, but who are eligible for profit-sharing.

This verification policy is to be used for salaried partners only.

Salaried partner income includes the following:

- Partner Fixed Income – fixed income / salary
- Partner Non-Fixed Income - e.g. profit sharing, bonus and other income incentives

|Restrictions|Verification|% Used for Servicing|
|---|---|---|
|Partner Fixed Income|Partner agreement or letter from employer stating current fixed income / salary or equivalent and 3 months’ salary credits to an account.|100% - fixed income|
|Partner Non-Fixed Income|Letter from employer stating minimum non-fixed income received over the past two years (e.g. profit sharing, bonus and other income incentives).|80% - non-fixed income|

Equity partners are to be treated as self-employed and must follow the self-employed income verification policy.

This verification policy is not to be used for small partnerships where all partners have control and management of the business. They must follow the self-employed income verification policy.

The Partner agreement may be dated more than six weeks prior to the application and must relate to the current employment arrangement and include:

- Employee's name
- Employer's name
- Terms and conditions of employment e.g. fixed income/salary.

The letter from the employer must be dated no more than six weeks prior to the application. And must be on company letterhead and include:

- Employee's name
- Employer's/business name
- ABN (except government bodies)

# Calculations

Partner Fixed Income

Using the net to gross calculator, input (base salary) credits as they appear on the three months' account statements to confirm the calculated annual gross salary amount is equal to or greater than the fixed income / salary stated on the Partner agreement or letter.

Use the fixed income / salary or equivalent stated on the Partner agreement or letter from employer.

Input income into the 'Gross Annual Salary or Wages' income field within the application.

Partner Non-Fixed Income

Use the lower of the two year’s non-fixed income amounts for servicing.

Input income into the 'Bonus' income field within the application.

Note: The system will automatically apply 80% of the full amount of non-fixed income for loan servicing.
