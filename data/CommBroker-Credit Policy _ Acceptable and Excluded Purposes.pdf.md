# Credit Policy | Acceptable and Excluded Purposes

What Certain situations are better suited to a loan than others. Below we’ve outline what is considered acceptable versus excluded (unacceptable) purposes for a loan.

Why To manage expectation and avoid disappointment, it’s important we ensure we provide customers with clarity around what is and what isn’t considered an acceptable purpose for a loan.

ACCEPTABLE PURPOSES

Loans to purchase transportable/relocatable homes or mobile residential homes.
Applications for "Personal Investment” (excluding cryptocurrency or digital assets) when not reliant on pe proposed investment asset for servicing or security and pere are no known payment obligations (e.g., Derivative contracts, partly paid shares, instalment warrants).
For new and existing customers pe maximum LVR (including capitalisation of LMI) is 80% and pe loan purpose is a 'personal investment’

You must understand the primary purpose of the loan funds, to determine if the customer's application should be a Home Loan or Home Loan.

CommBroker-Credit Policy | Acceptable and Excluded Purposes

Investment Home Loan. If the proposed loan has multiple purposes, the primary purpose is one with the greatest dollar value.

Multi-Purpose Securities: If the proposed loan is to purchase an Owner Occupied house and a granny flat to be rented out, you must select Home Loan in the application as the primary use of the loan funds is personal purposes.

Impact of Split Purpose Loans: Customers should seek independent tax advice on the structure of the as there may be benefits in splitting loan purposes into separate facilities for tax purposes.

# PROPERTY USE

The security property of the loan may be different to the loan type. e.g. an Owner Occupied security property with an Investment Home Loan with the loan purpose of personal investment. For a property use to be defined as Owner Occupied the customer must:

- Intend to reside in the property on a permanent or periodic basis.
- Not claim any rental income from the property.
- Not claim tax deductibility or negative gearing.

If the borrower can't confirm the above for the property, it's not an Owner Occupied property and is classified as an Investment property.

Note: Where the property purpose changes, e.g. the customer’s existing Owner Occupied property will now be used for investment purposes, the Home Loan needs to be updated to the correct loan type Investment Home Loan.

This can be completed:

- At the customer's request.
- When applying for additional loan funds (full application or Top Up).

# PROPERTIES WITH EXISTING TENANCY LEASE AGREEMENT

You can originate a new loan application as owner occupied when your customer is purchasing a property as their principal place of residence but cannot live in it immediately as it has a tenancy lease expiring within 6 months of settlement.

Eligibility Criteria

1. Customer’s intent is to move into the property as their principal place of residence immediately after tenancy ends
2. Contract of Sale shows tenancy will expire within 6 months of settlement
3. No rental income or negative gearing will be used for servicing of the owner occupied home loan application.
4. Customer will have sufficient funds to finance rent/board expenses during this period when they are unable to move into the property. Note – You can use the rental income for the period the property is tenanted to calculate the customers Net Cash position

Further considerations Provide sufficient commentary regarding the customers scenario for assessment referencing the above eligibility criteria
