Contractor - Contracted Employees

A contracted employee is someone who is employed by an employer (generally over a contracted term). They have similar working conditions to PAYG employees and may work full time, part time or casual hours.

Income and wages paid for duties performed are paid to the employee as a net salary, after tax. They receive the net salary as a regular wage. All income taxes, deductions and superannuation are paid by the employer.

They have no business running expenses and take no commercial risk for the duties performed within the business. They do not make a profit or loss for work performed.

Examples of contracted employees would be an individual working on contract in the IT and Finance industries. Contracted employees are to be treated as PAYG.

It is important to understand the customer's employment arrangements (e.g. whether they are contracted permanently or work casual hours, and their leave entitlements) to determine the most appropriate PAYG income verification method that reflects the customer's income.

|Restrictions|Verification|% Used for Servicing|
|---|---|---|
|None|For income verification requirements, refer to either: PAYG Base income (Full Time / Permanent Part Time) for contractors to be treated as Full Time/Permanent Part Time or; PAYG Casual and Temporary for contractors to be treated as Casual/Temporary|100%|

Note: Refer to Independent Contractors for contractors who are to be considered self-employed.
