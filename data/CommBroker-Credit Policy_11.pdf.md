Calculation

Option 1

Using the income calculator, input credits as they appear on the three months' account statements and/or Internet banking transaction listings. Credits containing bonus or commission payments must be excluded from calculations. It is acceptable to use other regular salary credits to a different account e.g. $50 per fortnight to a credit union account, provided these are also verified to the applicable account statement and/or Internet banking transaction listings.

Option 2

Using the income calculator, annualise the YTD # amount from payslip.

Option 3

Step 1: Using the income calculator, annualise the YTD # amount stated in the letter or payslip.

Step 2: Compare the annualised amount calculated in step 1 to the PAYG payment summary/’Tax ready’ Income Statement or Tax Return or a final YTD payslip from the preceding financial year and use the lower amount.

#Note:

Where the YTD amount on the payslips contains bonus / commission payments, and these are detailed on the payslip, deduct those amounts from the YTD amount prior to annualising the income. If however the YTD amount contains bonus / commission payments and these are not detailed on the payslip, an alternate method to calculate the customer’s PAYG income must be used.

Other/Special Notes

Any related commitments, e.g. car loan or equipment finance, must be included as a liability to calculate servicing.
