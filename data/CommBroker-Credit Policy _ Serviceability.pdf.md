# Credit Policy | Serviceability

Serviceability comes down to one question: Does the customer have enough income after commitments and expenses to afford the loan? To answer this we need to assess three areas: income (gross and net), expenses and conduct.

# INCOME:

Please refer to Income Eligibility

# COMMITMENTS AND EXPENSES:

Helps us understand the customer's full financial situation, including existing debts and obligations plus the cost of borrowing.

# CONDUCT:

We look to ensure the customer has a ‘track record’ of meeting their financial obligations.

# COMMITMENTS AND EXPENSES CALCULATION

For Calculation of existing commitments, refer to Calculating Product Commitments

Note: Repayment includes debt commitments on a fully amortised basis plus ongoing rental payments. If a customer is close to retirement, refer to the Retirement Rule. The assessment rates above apply for existing Low Doc Loans.
