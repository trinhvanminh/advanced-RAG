Commercial property is not acceptable:

However, Commercial Property, as defined below, may be taken as supplementary security for Consumer Lending products to avoid the need for LMI where the security will:

- Provide an overall LVR that does not exceed the combined Security Lending Margins applicable to each security type; and
- The LVR against residential security solely is not more than 100%.

For New Loans

The ESV of the Commercial Property is to be input as Nil, thus enabling these loans to be identified as requiring 100% risk weighting for Capital Adequacy.
