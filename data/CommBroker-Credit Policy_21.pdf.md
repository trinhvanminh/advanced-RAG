# Credit Policy

Eligible Income

Self-Employed

Self-employed customers derive their income from their own business. They earn income and pay out business expenses during the year, with the difference between their income and expenses being their profit or loss.

At the end of the financial year, self-employed customers must account for all their income by completing financial statements/tax returns which are lodged with the taxation office.

The assessing officer reserves the right to seek additional information if considered necessary.

A minimum of 2 years trading history must be confirmed. When adopting the specialised professions policy, a trading period of less than 2 years can be accepted where at least 12 months experience in the same industry can be evidenced. Individual circumstances can be considered by a credit assessor if the application is deemed creditworthy.

‘Full verification’ and/or ‘Simple verification’ is not required for salaried partners in Law, Accounting and/or Consulting Firms. Refer to the relevant policy in ‘PAYG Law, Accounting and/or Consulting Firm Partner Income’.

‘Full verification’ must be used for applications where there is CommBank commercial exposure and the application requires assessment by the Business Credit team.

You are not required to verify/capture self-employed income where there is no reliance on salary and/or profits from the customer’s business or company. However you will need to confirm and include in the application comments that the business, from which the self-employed income is derived, is trading profitably. For sole trader and partnerships only, you must ensure business liabilities have also been included for servicing. For companies, you are not required to include business liabilities for servicing.

Low documentation loans are quarantined and are no longer available.

# Process

# Full Verification

Step 1

- Enter the business income (including profit/loss) as per the self-employed calculator.
- Note:
- - When entering the self-employed income, you will need to input the income details from both years into the corresponding self-employed fields to ensure the correct income average is calculated.
- When entering income from a Company, you will need to enter the applicant’s percentage of ownership, the Company’s annual Loan Repayments and Salary/Director’s fees.
- For trust applications, where the net profit/loss has been fully distributed the amount is to be captured as $0

Enter any of the below acceptable addbacks (only if required for servicing):
- - Interest expense - Where the interest expense is to continue, the related commitment must be included in servicing
- Depreciation expense – The write down of assets used in producing income
- General depreciation is normally accounted for over a number of years and should be added back as a depreciation expense. Where the full depreciation is written off in the first year - under either 'Simplified Depreciation' or "Instant Write Off' the addback should be included as a Non-Recurring Expense. (All depreciation will be added as non-recurring expenses. In order to have general depreciation expenses treated as a tax-free add back, two years depreciation schedules will need to be provided).
- Amortisation - The write down of intangible assets
- Lease/Hire Purchase - Where the lease/hire purchase is to continue, the related commitment must be included in servicing
- Non-recurring expenses - Full details of the non-recurring expenses are necessary to justify why it should be added back
- Non-recurring income (deduction) - Details of the non-recurring income must be obtained
- Superannuation* – The amount paid in excess of the compulsory superannuation contribution set by the ATO

* Superannuation is to be entered into the 'Extra Super Contributions' field.

For applicants who are sole traders:

- Broker must ensure that all personal and business commitments are entered into the applicant's individual balance sheet.

For applicants who earn their income from a partnership:

- The system will automatically distribute addbacks as per policy and percentage of ownership.
- Broker must ensure that all personal and business commitments are entered into the applicant's individual balance sheet.

For applicants who earn their income from company:

- The system will automatically distribute addbacks as per policy and percentage of ownership.
- The system will automatically distribute any remaining profits after annual Company Loan Repayments and Salary/Directors fees have been deducted according to percentage of ownership.
- Brokers must ensure that all business commitments are entered in the income Company Loan Repayments and not the applicant’s individual balance sheet.

NOTE: Whenever you are entering the most recent financial year (MRFY) and the previous financial year (PFY) into the two columns:

Where there is an upward trend of up to 120% between the MRFY and the PFY, servicing will be assessed using the MRFY figures in isolation.

For all other scenarios, servicing will be assessed using the lower of the average of the two years or the most recent year.

If... Then...

Servicing is achieved End of procedure Provide commentary to explain the variance

MRFY is greater than +20% of the PFY and the MRFY is the more accurate reflection of the business’ performance Provide supporting documents such as 6 months BAS, 6 months bank statements or interim financials End of procedure

Step 4

You want to use a self-employed income verification method that is not within policy e.g. trading for less than 2 years. Note: You can use the Serviceability calculator to confirm the annual growth rate once you’ve entered the two years financials into both columns and clicking the ‘NMS’ link in the top left corner to open the policy metrics screen and navigating to the ‘Annual Growth Rate’ section.

The below table and guidance should not be used for any other purpose. Only commitments in the company’s name should be included in this field. Commitments in the applicant’s name or business (i.e. sole trader or partnership) should be included in the applicant’s personal balance

# CommBroker-Credit Policy

For all commitments, evidence could include (but is not limited to) one of the following:

- Statement with most recent repayments
- Loan contract evidencing repayments
- Balance sheet evidencing balance reducing over 2 years
- Internet printout from OFI institution showing repayment

Notes

Entering multiple self-employed customers:

Where your customer has multiple self-employed income sources please ensure you:

- Provide comments detailing how income should be captured for each self-employed income source.

You should capture and record each employment type with the applicable business name in ApplyOnline and CommApply.

Non-standard self-employed income verification scenarios (outside of policy)

Non-standard verification scenarios can be considered.

In addition to the standard documents required under the current self-employed full verification method, you must also provide:

- Mitigating comments to consider your non-standard verification method
- Additional documentary evidence to support your request

Definition of “Most Recent Financials”

The definition of “most recent financials” (MRF) revolves around a defined cut-off date.

If the application date is before the cut-off date, MRF is two tax financial years’ previous.

If the application date is after the cut-off date, MRF is the most recently finished tax financial year.

Miscellaneous notes:

Calculate the total loan amount on the actual P&I interest rate over the remaining P&I loan term.

Amortise the limit at the actual interest rate over a notional 15 year term.

Multiply the limit by 2.5% (minimum $25 per month).

Excluded from serviceability calculations:

Where the customer is a director / shareholder in a company the loan commitments for the company do not need to be included in the applicant's individual.
