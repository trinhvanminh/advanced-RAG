Investment Income (Proposed)

Proposed investment income is the income to be generated by any asset (excluding rental properties) that the customer is purchasing, e.g. dividends from the purchase of shares or distribution from the purchase of managed funds.

Proposed investment income is an excluded income and will not be considered. Investment income will only be considered for existing investment holdings when the existing investment has no margin loan attached (unencumbered), refer Investment income (Existing) for details.
