# About this policy

Why this policy? This policy will help you determine the maximum loan term when assessing a residential loan application. Refer to individual Product Policies for any additional loan term restrictions or requirements that may apply to specific products.

https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000680

If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to Lenders Mortgage Insurance where required.

2. Rules you must apply

2.1 Maximum loan term

The maximum term for an amortising loan is 30 years including any initial interest only (IO) period, however this may depend on the applicant’s age. The maximum term for a Bridging Loan is 12 months.

For details regarding maximum Interest Only terms refer to the table Maximum loan terms for interest only (IO) products.

Consideration should be given to the applicant’s remaining time in the workforce. The applicant’s ability to retire or service the new debt without the applicant incurring substantial hardship post retirement age must be considered.

The ability to meet repayment obligations and clear the debt may be from:

- Income (including retirement income), or
- Asset equity including the sale of an asset (other than primary place of residence except where the sale and downsize of the property is appropriate)

2.1.1 Maximum Loan Term for interest only (IO) products

|Category|Policy rule|
|---|---|
|Interest only (IO) converting loans repayment term|The maximum interest only repayment period is determined by the purpose of the loan as follows: Owner occupied – the interest only repayment period may be for a minimum of 1 year up to a maximum of 5 years. Investment – the interest only repayment period may be for a minimum of 1 year up to a maximum of 10 years. The contract loan term will be the total of the IO period plus the amortising principal and interest (P&I) period. The maximum total term is 30 years, noting: Construction loans exclude the maximum 24-month construction period (i.e. the interest only period allowable to complete construction) when calculating maximum loan term. Refer to Serviceability Assessment &gt; Payment used for serviceability IO loans are to have a minimum loan term of the requested IO repayment period and at least an additional 1-year P&I term. IO terms can be extended within product maximums. i.e. 2 year initial term and a further 3 years applied via a term extension. After the maximum IO term expires, the loan must be converted to P&I repayments. Further IO terms will require reorigination For an existing owner occupied or investment loan, any requests for extension beyond the maximum IO repayment period will require the loan to be re-originated to legacy policy|

2.2 Exit (Repayment) Strategy – Responsible Lending

During the Requirement and Objective (R&O) conversation, where any applicant or Income Guarantor ('Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal - Income Guarantee') is 45 years or older, the lender / assessor (via the broker) must:

- Make further enquiries to find out when the applicant or Income Guarantor intends to retire (retirement age) and follow the additional requirements detailed in the Retirement age and exit / repayment strategy table.
- Provide the applicant / income guarantor’s with an estimate of the projected outstanding loan balance at their declared retirement age.
- Record the declared retirement age and the projected outstanding loan balance at the declared retirement age in the “what you told us” (Responsible lending questions) section of the loan application.
- Where the applicant / income guarantor’s is:
- Equal to or greater than 55 years of age;
- 45 years or older and is less than 10 years from retirement, then the declared exit / repayment strategy must also be documented.

Where there is more than one applicant / income reliant guarantor, the age of the oldest applicant or income guarantor is to be used when assessing the maximum loan term.

Where a combination of exit / repayment strategies will be used, the details of each strategy must be documented.

When the applicant / income guarantor’s is relying on one or more of the below strategies, the associated asset values (where applicable) must be greater than or equal to the amortised loan amount for the loan being requested at the intended retirement age.
