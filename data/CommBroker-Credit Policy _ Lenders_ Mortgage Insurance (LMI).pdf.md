# Credit Policy | Lenders' Mortgage Insurance (LMI)

LMI is required where there is an increased risk associated with a home loan. The circumstances of the loan determine whether LMI may apply.

LMI offers protection to the bank in the event that the borrower cannot pay back the home loan. The customer could remain liable for any unpaid portion of the loan.

LMI helps broaden out who can take out home loans by taking some of the Bank’s risk out of lending money, and it means more people can get the home they want sooner.

The maximum allowable LVR and when LMI applies depends on the circumstances of the loan. See Security Lending Margins and refer to the Postcode Lookup Tool.
