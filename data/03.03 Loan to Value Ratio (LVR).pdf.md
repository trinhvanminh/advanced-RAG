# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

A consumer mortgage application.

# 1.2 What is LVR?

LVR is a term used to express the percentage ratio of a loan to the value of an asset or assets that provide security collateral for a loan.

The bank uses LVR to:

- Assign a maximum percentage we will lend against security property offered, with or without mortgage insurance
- Show the amount of lending (expressed as a percentage ratio) a customer may already have against a collateral
- Identify when Lender’s Mortgage (LMI) is required

By using the assigned LVRs in this policy and the security collateral value of the property, we can determine the lending value of the offered security collateral.

For definition relating to LVR, refer to Glossary for further details.

# 2. Rules you must apply

# 2.1 Maximum base and / or capped LVR

The maximum base LVR assigned to a loan is determined by a number of risk characteristics of the application.

Based on the risk characteristics, a lower LVR threshold will override the maximum base LVR for owner-occupied and investment security detailed below.

|Category|Maximum base LVR|
|---|---|
|Owner occupied|Non-mortgage insured loan: 80%|
| |Mortgage insured loan: 95% inclusive of any capitalised mortgage insurance (MI) premium (if available)|
| |Note: An Owner Occupied product should only be selected where the funds are ‘wholly or predominantly to be for personal, domestic or household use’|
|Investment|Non-mortgage insured loan: 80%|
| |Mortgage insured loan: 90% inclusive of any capitalised mortgage insurance premium (if available)|
| |The following is permitted where:|
| |Investment Property Loans (either standalone or combined with a home loan) with at least one security collateral being owner occupied can be considered up to 95% inclusive of any capitalised MI premium|
| |Investment Property Loans (either standalone or combined with a home loan or line of credit) with all security collateral being Non-owner occupied can be considered up to 90% inclusive of any capitalised MI premium.|

|Category|Action|
|---|---|
|Multiple risk characteristics|Apply the lowest LVR - for example: The LVR for a residential detached house is 80% and for a borrower using acceptable foreign income for serviceability the LVR is 70%. The LVR for a residential detached house is 80% and for a borrower who is a resident of Greece the LVR is 0% LVR. In this situation, we would not be able to proceed as the lowest LVR is 0%.|
|Multiple security collateral|Apply the relevant LVR to each type of security collateral to determine the total lending value. The sum of the lending value of each proposed security is the total amount the bank will consider lending against all securities (see Case examples in this policy).|

For further information about risk characteristics refer to:

- LVR by borrower type and income source
- LVR by product features and purpose
- LVR by property value
- LVR by security collateral location
- LVR by security collateral type
- Unacceptable security collateral

# 2.3 Lenders Mortgage Insurance –additional requirements

Where lenders’ mortgage insurance (LMI) is required:

- Refer to Lenders Mortgage Insurance
- Maximum exposure to a single borrower is $2.5M across Group (Westpac, St.George, RAMS) where LMI is required

# 2.4 LVR by borrower type and income source

Where there are two or more applicants (borrower or income guarantor) included on the loan application, the most conservative policy must be applied regardless of their contribution to the loan, for example: An Australian citizen who is married to a permanent resident visa holder, living in Australia and earning foreign income, will be restricted to a maximum LVR of 70%, and all policies applicable to the permanent resident visa holder applicant, will apply. Note: Applicants who meet the Bank's definition of a non-resident as per Lending to Non-Australian Citizens policy > Non-Resident lending are unacceptable to the Bank and no lending is permitted.

Refer to Lending to Non-Australian Citizens policy for acceptable visa class and confirmation if LMI available

2.10 Second mortgage

The bank takes a second mortgage over a security property, where there is a prior mortgagee (e.g. where the first mortgage is held by another financial institution).

STG, BSA, BoM and RAMS are considered to be other financial institutions.

Mortgage insurance is not available where a second mortgage applies.

For more information about assessing the second mortgage applications you may also refer to Acceptable Security Collateral &gt; Certificate of title &gt; Second Mortgage behind other financial institution (OFI)

# Debt allocation / Debt apportioning

Debt allocation may be required when assessing a loan application (new origination or variation) where the borrower:

- Has an existing debt secured by two or more properties and the existing debt is not being refinanced (either partially or in full), and
- Not all properties securing the existing debt will be used as security collateral in the new loan.

Note: Debt allocation is not required where all the security collateral properties for the existing debt are being offered as security collateral for the new loan origination or variation.

The following debt allocation principles apply:

- For properties offered as security collateral on the new loan, the market value from an existing acceptable valuation (where applicable) or new valuation, is the market value used in the new loan application
- Where a property is not being used as security collateral for the new loan but will remain a security collateral for an existing debt, it is shown as an asset property in the new loan application. The value of the asset property entered will be the market value from an existing valuation where it is acceptable to be re-used, or a new valuation (where the existing valuation cannot be re-used), refer Security Collateral Value Assessment > Re-using an Existing Valuation.
- Where two or more new loans are proceeding at the same:
- Under a single submission, each new loan must mirror each other, i.e. all new loans must reflect the other new loan(s), regardless of whether or not the new loans will settle / draw down simultaneously, or
- In concurrent submissions and:
- Settling simultaneously, then each concurrent loan must mirror each other.
- Not settling simultaneously (i.e. waterfall), application supporting notes must identify the order in which the loans will settle / draw down and each new loan must be reflected in any subsequent concurrent application.

The maximum permitted non-LMI LVR is applied to each security collateral and asset property, which may include a higher LVR policy where LMI is waived (e.g. Medico 90%), refer to rules in this chapter. Noting however, that lower LVR thresholds may apply according to borrower type and income source, product features and purpose, property value, security location and type e.g. where foreign income is included in servicing a max LVR 70% applies to all security collateral(s) and existing asset property(s).

Debt allocation can only be applied between properties owned by the borrower(s).

Debt allocation cannot be applied where:

- The security collateral is partially or fully owned by a non-borrower, e.g. where a family security guarantee supports an existing debt.
- Any of the existing security collateral are under construction, until such time as the loan has been fully advanced and the construction is complete. This includes where an existing construction loan has multiple security collateral.
- An application is Mortgage insured, unless all insured security collateral are linked to the new loan. Where this occurs, the LMI premium will be calculated on the TSE and will require referral to Mortgage Insurer for a manual premium calculation.

# Case examples

# Refinance or cash out for foreign income earner

|Category|Examples|
|---|---|
|Acceptable|It is acceptable where an existing customer is going to cross collateralise the security/loans and there is no cash out to the customer, only additional funds for the purchase settlement.|
|Not acceptable|It is not acceptable where an existing customer wants to access equity to assist with a new purchase, but is not cross collateralising the security, i.e. each transaction will be standalone. The release of equity is classified as cash out and not permitted. The new loan for the purchase may proceed at LVR 70% but no additional equity release against the existing property is possible. It does not matter if the proposed new loan is with Westpac or external financier.|
