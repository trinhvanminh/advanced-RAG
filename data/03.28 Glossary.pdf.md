National Rental Affordability Scheme - A government backed incentive scheme that seeks to address the shortage of affordable rental housing by offering financial incentives to the business sector and community organisations to build and rent dwellings to low and moderate income households at lower levels compared to market rates. NRAS aims to increase the supply of new rental dwellings and improve rental affordability. There are two distinct NRAS structures:

|NRAS|Head leases|
|---|---|
| |Some schemes operate on a head-lease structure where the scheme operator leases the property from the investor for a 10-year period and in turn sub-leases it to a qualifying tenant. Under this structure the investor has little or no control over the selection of tenants or the selection of the property manager (with the scheme operator generally taking care of both).|
| |Non-entity joint ventures (NEJV)|
