# Credit Policy

Eligible Income

Self-Employed income policy for specialised professions

Self-employed customers derive their income from their own business. They earn income and pay out business expenses during the year, with the difference between their income and expenses being their profit or loss. At the end of the financial year, self-employed customers must account for all their income by completing financial statements/tax returns which are lodged with the taxation office. The assessing officer reserves the right to seek additional information if considered necessary. A minimum of 2 years trading history must be confirmed. When adopting the specialised professions policy, a trading period of less than 2 years can be accepted where at least 12 months experience in the same industry can be evidenced. Individual circumstances can be considered by a credit assessor if the application is deemed creditworthy.

Tables showing eligible occupations, required eligibility criteria and income thresholds can be found further down the page in the ‘Eligible Medical and Industry Professionals’ section.

Definition of “Most Recent Financials”

The definition of “most recent financials” (MRF) revolves around a defined cut-off date. The date of the application in relation to the cut-off date determines which financial year is considered the MRF for the serviceability assessment. The methodology is:

- If the application date is before the cut-off date, MRF is two tax financial years’ previous
- If the application date is after the cut-off date, MRF is the most recently finished tax financial year

For example, if the relevant cut-off date is 30 April and the application is submitted on 28 April 2024, the MRF is the financial year ending 30 June 2022. If the application is submitted on 2 May 2024, the MRF is the financial year ending 30 June 2023.

The cut-off date for customers satisfying all of the following criteria is 30 June:

- The business / company has been trading for at least 3 years; and
- They have an existing home loan, business loan or business transaction account with CommBank or Bankwest that has been open for at least 6 months; and
- They have had no defaults on their CommBank or Bankwest facilities, nor dishonours or overdraws on their business transaction accounts, for at least 6 months.

For all other customers, the cut-off date is 28 February.

Miscellaneous notes:

- Where the customer is a director / shareholder in a company the loan commitments for the company do not need to be included in the applicant's individual balance sheet of the Home Loan application.
- Where the customer is a sole proprietor or in a partnership the loan commitments for the business must be included in the applicant's individual balance sheet of the Home Loan application.
- Where a customer has multiple self-employed income sources you will have to verify the income using either all simple or all full verification, you cannot use a combination of the two methods.
- ‘Full verification’ must be used for applications where there is CommBank commercial exposure and the application requires assessment by the Business Credit team.
