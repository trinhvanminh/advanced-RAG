# 1. About this policy

1.1 Why this policy

This policy identifies all acceptable guarantee types and their associated requirements. You must read this policy in conjunction with:

- Acceptable Security Collateral
- Commitments
- Document Standards
- Eligibility
- Genuine Savings, Equity and Customer Contribution
- Living Expenses
- Loan to Value Ratio (LVR)
- Maximum Loan Term
- Security Collateral Value Assessment
- Self-employed applicants
- Serviceability Assessment
- Loan Application and Approval > Validation of information provided by the customer
- Verifying income

If the loan application requires mortgage insurance, refer to Lenders Mortgage Insurance where required.

1.2 What is a guarantee?

A guarantee is a contractual promise given by a third party, i.e. the guarantor, who agrees, that in the event the customers are unable or unwilling to repay the loan, the guarantor is liable for the amount of the limited guarantee.

1.3 National Credit Code and Banking Code of Practice

The National Credit Code (NCC) and the Banking Code of Practice (BCoP) provide protections to individuals who enter into a guarantee as security for a loan. For details of the Banking Code of Practice requirements relating to Guarantees, refer to Banking Code of Practice (BCoP).

Also refer to:

- Independent legal advice
- Guarantee amount-NCC and BCoP

In all instances, prospective guarantors are to be informed that they need to make any appropriate enquiries about the credit worthiness, financial position and integrity of the borrowers. This should be pointed out at application and again at approval. (The prospective guarantors are reminded of this prior to signing the Guarantee and Indemnity.)

# 2. Rules you must apply

2.1 Guarantee types and guarantors

For Consumer Lending policy, the Bank requires a guarantor to be an individual. An entity cannot be a guarantor.

The ‘Policy rules per guarantee type' tables specify:

Link to Guarantee Type Tables

WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

Acceptability is also subject to:
- Appropriate assessment of pe borrower and guarantor Requirements and Objectives
- All credit requirements being met
The acceptable guarantors according to pe guarantee type
Oper applicable policy rules

Exceptions may be considered by Credit, subject to strong mitigating reasons being provided.

2.1.1 Guarantor direct benefit

Requirements for establishing that the guarantor will receive a direct benefit will vary from one application to another. Westpac Group is required to demonstrate that the guarantor made a fully informed decision and will receive a measurable benefit that is comparable to the risk they are taking on. A financial benefit is the easiest to define and measure (e.g. the guarantor living in the property they are guaranteeing free of rent). Non-financial benefit is more difficult to measure and is, therefore, unlikely to be approved where the relationship is something other than a parent guaranteeing a loan for their children or a Shared Equity Guarantee.

2.1.2 ‘Other’ Guarantee types

Guarantee types other than those specified under ‘Policy rules per guarantee type' are generally not acceptable unless a Guarantor direct benefit can be established. Credit approval is required for any ‘other’ guarantee type, and the application must be referred to Credit for assessment before any provisional approval decision is advised to the borrower.

Regardless of the guarantee amount, the borrowers are required to contribute a minimum 5% of the value of a security collateral being purchased plus purchase costs. These funds:

- Are to be visible in the applicants' assets with a comment in ApplyOnline detailing which assets are being used to meet this requirement
- Are not required to comply with Genuine Savings policy

2.1.3 Unacceptable Guarantors

- Non-Residents - refer to Lending to Non-Australian Citizens policy
- Temporary Australian Residency Visa Holders - refer to Lending to Non-Australian Citizens policy >Visa Matrix and Applicant via Resident Type Matrix
- Permanent Australian Residency Visa holder not holding an acceptable borrower visa type as per the Lending to Non-Australian Citizens policy >Visa Matrix and Applicant via Resident Type Matrix
- Entities
- Where all security collateral(s) offered have 100% guarantor ownership (i.e. The borrower must have ownership of at least one security collateral being offered)
- For Family-Security Guarantee, Guarantor relationships other than those listed are unacceptable e.g. non-guardians, uncles, aunts, grandparents, non-family members
- Any guarantor not identified as acceptable in this policy, or approved as an exception by Credit

2.3 Guarantee amount-NCC and BCoP

Under NCC a guarantee can secure an amount that does not exceed the sum of the borrower’s liabilities, plus reasonable expenses of enforcing the guarantee, or any lesser amount agreed between us and the guarantor. BCoP also requires a guarantee to limit the guarantor’s liability.

2.4 Calculating available equity, guarantee amount and LVR

2.4.1 Family-Security Guarantee

The amount of available equity in security collateral offered as the ‘Family –Security Guarantee’ must be determined, to ensure there is sufficient equity to provide the guarantee. The LVR calculation allows us to determine whether the loan requires mortgage insurance.

# Providing advice to borrowers and guarantors

The guarantor must be interviewed separately in the absence of the borrower. When the proposed loan is either wholly or in part secured by a guarantee, the ‘Advice requirements’ in the table below apply.

|Applicant type|Advice requirements|
|---|---|
|Borrower|- The prospective borrowers must be made aware of the following requirements at the time of the interview:
- Loans that involve individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Family-Security Guarantee’, 'Shared Equity Guarantee', ‘Spousal-Security Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee’ are conditional on the guarantors obtaining independent legal advice and the Bank requires evidence that legal advice has been obtained.
- Independent legal advice is recommended but not mandatory for individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Spousal-Income Guarantee’
- The solicitor's cost is the responsibility of the guarantor (or borrower).
- Do not provide any advice in respect to the nature and effect of the guarantee.
- Do not entrust the customer / borrower to act as Westpac's 'agent' to procure the guarantor's signature. Hand a copy of the Guarantor's Consent to Variation, Replacement or Alteration (LD164) to each guarantor. Alternatively, the consent form can be posted to the individual guarantor.
|
|Guarantor|- The guarantor/s must be interviewed separately by the broker without the borrower present.
- At the interview, all prospective guarantors must be made aware of that:
- Independent legal advice and evidence of this advice is mandatory for guarantee types of 'Family-Security Guarantee’, 'Shared Equity Guarantee', ‘Spousal-Security Guarantee’ or ‘Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee’
- Independent legal advice is recommended but not mandatory for individuals providing a guarantee type of ‘Spousal-Income Guarantee’
- There are financial risks involved in providing a guarantee, i.e. when the borrower is unable to meet their financial obligations under the loan, the guarantor may need to pay for the debt commitments on behalf of the borrower.
- The guarantor may request information about the proposed loan to be guaranteed.
|

# Independent legal advice

‘Policy rules per acceptable guarantee type’ details when independent legal advice is required according to the guarantee type

https://creditriskpolicies.westpac.com.au/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1000696

If legal advice is required, the guarantor needs to obtain this from a solicitor independent of the bank and the borrower to understand their obligations and liability under the guarantee. The completed Guarantor’s Solicitor’s Certificate is to be provided to the Bank prior to settlement (i.e. release of loan funds) to evidence that independent legal advice has been received. Waiving of independent legal advice where it is required under policy may only be approved by Credit on exception basis.

2.6.1 Determining written legal advice evidence requirements

|State|Requirements|
|---|---|
|Australian Capital Territory|A solicitor’s or barrister’s certificate|
|Victoria|A solicitor’s or barrister’s certificate|
|Northern Territory|Independent legal advice is difficult to get in South Australia, Western Australian and Tasmania. However, the inability to obtain this advice is not grounds to warrant a waiver|
|South Australia|Independent legal advice is difficult to get in South Australia, Western Australian and Tasmania. However, the inability to obtain this advice is not grounds to warrant a waiver|
|Queensland|Independent legal advice is difficult to get in South Australia, Western Australian and Tasmania. However, the inability to obtain this advice is not grounds to warrant a waiver|
|Tasmania|Independent legal advice is difficult to get in South Australia, Western Australian and Tasmania. However, the inability to obtain this advice is not grounds to warrant a waiver|
|New South Wales|Statutory declaration made by the guarantor and witnessed by: The solicitor who gave the legal advice A justice of the peace, who is a member of the Australian Institute of Conveyancers|

Note: The solicitor's certificate makes provision for more than one guarantor. Nevertheless, as a matter of policy, the documentation pack will include a separate form of certificate for each guarantor (certificates that have been amended to include more than one guarantor will be accepted). It is not for the Bank to be instructing solicitors as to who might be present at the time the advice is given.

2.6.2 Independence of the solicitor

The guarantor's solicitor must be independent of the Bank and the borrower, this includes:

- The solicitor is not to be a solicitor for the Bank or for the borrower in the particular transaction
- The solicitor is not being a solicitor for any other interested party who might have previously given security. An example of an interested party is a guarantor who, having previously provided security, stands to benefit by way of reduced liability, from any additional security given by other guarantors.
- The solicitor is not to be a partner of any solicitor who acts for the borrower or other interested party.

Exemption of independence rule

The solicitor can amend the certificate to signify that they also act for the borrower. Westpac Group, as a matter of policy exception, will generally accept the solicitor's certificate in such cases. Exemption will not apply, for example, if:

A guarantor is open to influence by the others, or One guarantor is a spouse of the director who 'runs' the business, and is only involved in a formal manner or in some minor capacity

Legal advice dispensation
Request for legal dispensation will be considered by Credit on an exception basis.

Determining undue influence on pe guarantor
If pe Bank knows, or suspects, pe guarantee relationship is one of dependency, reliance, or dominance, you must insist on independent legal advice and a solicitor’s certificate. Operwise, pe courts might presume pat pere was undue influence and set aside pe guarantee.

To help to determine whether there is undue influence, consider the following questions:

1. Might anyone, in addition to the borrower, benefit from the guarantee being given?
- Other individuals who have already given, or are about to give, guarantees (e.g. husband and wife)
- If the borrower is a trust, a beneficiary of the trust, or
- Anybody else who has a significant direct or indirect interest in the borrower (e.g. shareholder)
2. What is the nature of the relationship between the guarantor and any other benefited person?
With some relationships there is a presumption of undue influence no matter (e.g. solicitor and client; parent and dependent child; trustee and beneficiary; priest and parishioner; doctor and patient). With others it depends on individual circumstances.

Where a spouse is providing a guarantee, it is strongly recommended to insist on a solicitor's certificate except where it is clear that the spouse is:

- Financially sophisticated
- Aware of the borrower's position
- Obtaining some benefit from the transaction.

|Example Scenario|Description|
|---|---|
|In the normal case of a spouse guaranteeing their partner's debts, the legal position is not clear. It is safer where a spouse is providing a guarantee to strongly recommend on a solicitor's certificate except where it is clear that the spouse is:|- Financially sophisticated
- Aware of the borrower's position
- Obtaining some benefit from the transaction.

|Family-Security Guarantees|Aged parents providing a guarantee to their children.|

# WBC Mortgage Broking OBP Policy

# 2.7 Financial Support Acknowledgement and Undertaking

The ‘Financial Support Acknowledgement and Undertaking’ must be signed by the guarantor for the below guarantee types:

- Spousal-Income Guarantee
- Spousal-Income + Security Guarantee

# 2.8 Accepting a guarantee- three (3) day requirement

Once the guarantor has been provided with:

- The terms and conditions of the guarantee
- Any notice of demand the Bank has made on the borrower in the past two years
- A copy of the borrower’s loan contract
- A copy of the borrower’s credit report
- A copy of the borrower’s financial accounts or statements held in the last two years for the guaranteed loan.
- A copy of any other information the guarantor reasonably requests about the guaranteed loan

Then the guarantor has a minimum of three days to consider the guarantee they are about to provide. We must not accept the signed and returned guarantee document until after the third day.

The only exceptions we will consider and allow the guarantee to be accepted prior to three days are as follows:

- If the guarantor has obtained independent legal advice and provided evidence
- If the guarantor is acting as trustee for a trust on the loan application.

Note: accepting the guarantee document back from the guarantor is different to requiring independent legal advice. All requirements of this policy must be met.

Refer to the Banking Code of Practice (BCOP) on signing and when to accept a guarantee.
