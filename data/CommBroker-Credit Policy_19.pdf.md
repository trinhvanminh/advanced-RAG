Workers Compensation and Income Protection

Workers compensation is a form of insurance payments to employees due to work related injury or illness. Income protection provides coverage for non-work related injuries or illness. Workers compensation and income protection both provide payments to cover a customer's salary/wage while they are not fit for work.

# Verification

|Workers Compensation|% Used for Servicing|
|---|---|
|Letter/statement from insurance company confirming the payment details e.g. payment amount, frequency and expiration date of payments| |
|Letter from employer confirming employees' current workers compensation arrangement and their expected/proposed return to work date.| |

|Income Protection|100%|
|---|---|
|Letter/statement from insurance company confirming the payment details, e.g. payment amount, frequency and expiration date of payments.| |
|Letter from employer confirming employees' expected/proposed return to work date and income amount.| |

NOTE: If the expected/proposed return to work income amount is lower than the current workers compensation and/or income protection, the lower amount must be used for servicing.
