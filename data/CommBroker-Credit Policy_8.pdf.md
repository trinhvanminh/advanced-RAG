# Calculations

# Option 1

Review salary credits for the past three months. Calculate the average by totaling the three months’ salary credits and dividing by the number of expected pay periods to obtain the average net income amount. Enter this amount into the income calculator and adopt the annual gross income amount. It is acceptable to use other regular salary credits, for example, credit union deposit of $100 per fortnight. The corresponding salary credits must be verified from the applicable account statement and/or Internet banking transaction listings. If the salary credits contain bonus or commission payments, these will need to be excluded from the income calculation.

Example:

|Customer is paid fortnightly.|Fortnightly net income|
|---|---|
|Fortnight 1:|$3,000|
|Fortnight 2:|$1,350|
|Fortnight 3:|$1,080|
|Fortnight 4:|$1,210|
|Fortnight 5:|$6,520|
|Fortnight 6:|$1,440|

Customer has confirmed that the fluctuation in pay/salary credits from fortnight to fortnight is due to regular overtime and allowance, however, in fortnight 1, the large amount was due to a commission payment and fortnight 5 was due to a bonus payment:

|Step|Action|Example|
|---|---|---|
|1.|Fortnight 1 and 5 must be excluded from calculations as it contains bonus and commission payments.|Average fortnightly net salary excluding bonus and commission is: $1,350 + $1,080 + $1,120 + $1,440 / 4 = $1,247.50|
|2.|Deduct the base salary/wage amount from the annualized YTD amount as calculated in step 1 to determine the overtime amount. Enter as two separate amounts in the home loan application:|Base salary/wage as Salary/Wages: $32,000pa Overtime as Regular Overtime: $4,679.75pa|
|3.|For Emergency Frontline, the Credit Assessor will confirm the customer meets the requirements and adjust the overtime to ensure the 100% is applied. For the Home Loan Servicing Model calculator, input the overtime as “Other Income” and 100% will be applied.|Base salary/wage: $32,000pa Overtime: $4,679.75pa|

# Option 2

Note: Where the YTD amount on the payslips contains bonus / commission payments, and these are detailed on the payslip, deduct those amounts from the YTD amount prior to annualising the income. If however the YTD amount contains bonus / commission payments and these are not detailed on the payslip, an alternate method to calculate the customer’s PAYG income must be used.

2 Deduct the base salary/wage amount stated on the payslip from the annualised amount calculated in step 1 to determine the overtime amount.

3 Enter as two separate amounts in the home loan application:

- Base salary/wage as Salary/Wages
- Overtime as Regular Overtime.

For Emergency Frontline the Credit Assessor will confirm the customer meets the requirements and adjust the overtime to ensure the 100% is applied. For the Home Loan Servicing Model calculator input the overtime as “Other Income” and 100% will be applied.
