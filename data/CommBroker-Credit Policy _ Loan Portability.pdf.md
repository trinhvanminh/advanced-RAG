# Credit Policy | Loan Portability

What Loan portability is available on all home/investment loan products. Here we give you an understanding of the circumstances suited to loan portability so you can easily determine if a customer is eligible.

Why Sometimes a customer decides to sell the existing and buy a new home. If they’re happy with their current home loan, loan portability allows them to take the loan with them (swapping the existing security with a new one) and save the hassle of refinancing.
