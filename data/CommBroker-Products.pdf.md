# 1. Description

Guarantor Support is available to assist customers obtain a home loan when they are unable to provide adequate security in cases where the loan amount exceeds normal lending margins; and/or if they are unable to provide adequate servicing (for non-personal borrowers only). Borrowers may consider adding co-borrowers to their loan application if they do not wish to obtain support from a guarantor.

# 2. Benefits

Guarantor Support enables customers (in particular first home buyers) to:

- Borrow more funds than they may have been eligible for without a guarantee
- Eliminate the need to pay for Lenders' Mortgage Insurance (LMI) or Low Deposit Premium (LDP) where the guarantee reduces the customer’s Loan Valuation Ratio (LVR) to a level where LMI is not required.

# Family Security Support

Family Security Support makes it possible for customers to get a home loan when they’re unable to provide adequate security to the Bank on their own. Family members of the borrower, i.e. a parent or guardian, adult child, sibling, or grandparent (it can also be a former spouse or legally appointed guardian) may offer the equity in their property in addition to the borrower's property being secured by the loan. Other family members (such as aunts/uncles) may only be accepted where approved by Credit. If approved, the family member guarantees the loan which is supported by the property they are offering as security.

Family Security Support isn’t available for:

- Borrowers who do not have an ownership interest in at least one security property supporting the loan unless the purpose of the borrowing provides direct benefit to the security provider (e.g. adult son or daughter borrowing for the purpose of providing aged care for their parents using their parent’s property as security)
- Individual guarantors receiving any type of Government Benefit (pension or payment) as their sole source of income, and using their principal place of residence as security, unless the security is in joint names with the borrower
- Off the plan purchases or loans where foreign income is used for servicing
- Individual guarantors who are not a family member of the borrower/s e.g. friend or neighbour
- Viridian Line of Credit (VLOCs)
- Loan purposes unrelated to the purchase, construction, renovation or refinance (where the original loan purpose was for purchase, construction or renovation) of a property (including personal investment, purchase of a car, personal goods, cash-out, debt consolidation etc.)
- Interest only repayments for the guaranteed loan account only (other than during a construction period)
- Transportable or mobile homes

Family Security Support required loan structure:

The required loan structure is an 80% / 20% split (plus costs to a maximum of 7%). The maximum loan amount for the guaranteed loan must not exceed 20% plus associated purchase costs to a maximum of 27% of the borrower’s property value. The maximum total lending against the guarantor’s security property must also not exceed 70% of the guarantor’s property value.

An 80 / 20 (plus costs) split is:

|Application 1 is secured by the:|Borrower's property only (80% of the borrower’s property value)|
|---|---|
|Application 2 (the remaining loan amount) is secured by the:|Borrower's property (20% plus costs to a maximum of 7% of the borrower’s property value); and Guarantor's property (total lending including any existing charges must not exceed 70% of the guarantor’s property value)|

If the borrower’s property is located in a postcode where LMI is required from a 70% LVR, the required loan structure is a 70% / 20% split (plus costs to a maximum of 7%).

A 70 / 20 (plus costs) split is:

|Application 1 is secured by the:|Borrower's property only (70% of the borrower’s property value)|
|---|---|
|Application 2 is secured by the:|Borrower's property (20% plus costs to a maximum of 7% of the borrower’s property value); and Guarantor’s property (total lending including any existing charges must not exceed 70% of the guarantor’s property value)|

Example: Purchase

Sally Smith wants to borrow $300,000 to buy a property (Property A) valued at $285,000 and also to cover the associated purchase costs. The Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) for this example is 105%, which is outside of acceptable security limits. To help Sally get her loan, her parents have agreed to provide to the Bank a mortgage over their property (Property B). Property B is valued at $500,000 with a prior CommBank mortgage of $150,000.

Sally's loan structure would be:

|Application 1| | |
|---|---|---|
|Loan amount: $228,000| | |
|In the name of: Sally Smith| | |
|Secured by: Property A| | |
|LVR: 80%, i.e. $228,000 / $285,000| | |
|Application 2| | |
|Loan amount: $72,000| | |
|In the name of: Sally Smith| | |
|Secured by:| | |
|Property A| | |
|Guarantee by Sally's parents supported by Property B| | |

# CommBroker-Products

Total lending on the guarantor’s security property = total debts and guarantees secured by the property ($150,000 + $72,000 = $222,000) / property value ($500,000) LVR = 44.4%

In this example:

- The loan amount for the guaranteed loan ($72,000) is equal to 25% of the purchase price of the new property ($285,000) inclusive of associate costs which is within the required cap of 27%.
- The total lending against the guarantor’s security property is also within the acceptable limit of 70%. This is calculated as total lending ($150,000 + $72,000 = $222,000) / property value ($500,000) = 44.4%.

Note: any redraw held needs to be considered when calculating total lending against the security value.

# Example: Top-up

Omar purchased land for $170,000 last year and is looking to construct a property.

Omar’s existing loan structure is:

|Loan amount: $140,000|secured by the land;|
|---|---|
|Loan amount: $36,000|secured by the land and his sister’s property.|

Omar needs an additional $300,000 to fund the construction of a property (as the land is already owned there are no purchase costs).

The new property is valued at $500,000 on completion.

Omar’s sister has offered her property valued at $350,000 as a guarantor security. The property secures an existing debt of $150,000.

The new loan structure will be:

|Application 1|Application 2|
|---|---|
|Loan amount: $400,000|Loan amount: $76,000|
|In the name of: Omar|In the name of: Omar|
|Secured by: Omar’s land and build|Secured by: Omar’s land and build|
|LVR: 80%, i.e. $400,000 / $500,000|Total lending on the guarantor’s security property = total debts and guarantees secured by the property ($150,000 + $76,000 = $226,000) / property value ($350,000) LVR = 64.57%|

In this example:

- The loan amount for the guaranteed loan ($76,000) is equal to 15.2% of the land and build value of the new property ($500,000) which is within the required cap of 20%.
- The total lending against the guarantor’s security property is also within the acceptable limit of 70%. This is calculated as total lending ($150,000 + $76,000 = $226,000) / property value ($350,000) = 64.57%.

# Guarantees for non-personal borrowers

A non-personal borrower is where at least one borrower is a non-trading company or a company as a trustee for a trust where the beneficiaries are individuals.

Where a non-personal borrower is involved in an application, guarantees are required from company directors, as well as shareholders when appropriate.

Guarantors may provide support to non-personal borrowers in one or both of these ways:

- Security Support: when the non-personal borrower is unable to provide adequate security for the borrowing amount, a guarantor may be willing to provide security to assist.
- Servicing Support: when the non-personal borrower is unable to service the loan amount based on their income and total repayment commitments, a guarantor may be willing to provide income to assist with the loan repayments.

For example:

Guarantor providing servicing support only

ABC Pty Ltd wants to borrow $300,000 to help purchase a new property.

ABC Pty Ltd.'s security property has been valued at $400,000.

Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) for this example is 75% and therefore within acceptable security limits.

Based on ABC Pty Ltd.'s current income and repayment commitments, ABC Pty Ltd can't service a $300,000 loan.

In order to help ABC Pty Ltd get the loan, a company director agrees to act as a guarantor and provide servicing support.

The guarantee provided is for the total amount of ABC Pty Ltd.'s loan.

Servicing capacity is assessed using both ABC Pty Ltd and the company director's incomes and repayment commitments, allowing ABC Pty Ltd to borrow the $300,000 it requires.

As no security is provided, it's an unsupported guarantee.

For non-personal borrowers, we may approve new and increased credit facilities if the total ongoing financial commitments (including both new and existing commitments) can be serviced by the:

- Borrower's eligible income; or
- Combined eligible incomes of the (non-personal) borrower and guarantor after allowing both the borrowers' and guarantors' ongoing financial commitments

You must consider the value of any security provided by the guarantor in the calculation of the Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) for the application. The security requirements for a guarantor are the same as those for a borrower.

Guarantor providing servicing and security support

ABC Pty Ltd wants to borrow $300,000 to help in purchasing a new property and also to cover the associated purchase costs.

The security property has been valued at $285,000

Loan to Valuation Ratio (LVR) is 105% and is outside acceptable security limits.

Based on ABC Pty Ltd.'s current income and commitments, the company can't service a $300,000 loan.

In order to help ABC Pty Ltd get the loan, a company director agrees to act as a supported guarantor and provide both servicing and security support.

The guarantee provided is for the total amount of ABC Pty Ltd.'s loan.

Servicing capacity is assessed using both ABC Pty Ltd and the company director's income and repayment commitments allowing ABC Pty Ltd to borrow the $300,000 it requires.

As the guarantee is supported by security, it's a supported guarantee.

|1.|Start a conversation to outline what a Guarantee is, assess why the individual wants to become a Guarantor and what their understanding is of providing a Guarantee|

Note:

- The key legal obligations involved in providing a guarantee are outlined in the Guarantor Guide.
- You must consider the guarantor’s unique circumstances when conducting the interview and record notes in the application. If there are any indicators identified – you must take extra care where appropriate and consider if the individual is still suitable to become a Guarantor as applicable.
- You must consider whether the Guarantor requires further support to understand the Guarantee
- Use your judgment during the interview to continually look for any vulnerabilities. Ask further questions as required to carefully understand the Guarantor’s situation. If you do identify any red flags you must terminate the interview and explain the Guarantor is not suitable. If you identify signs of financial abuse or vulnerability, please follow the steps detailed in Financial Abuse procedure.

Discuss the risks and explain the key Banking Code of Practice (BCOP) disclosures:

- Explain the risks of providing a guarantee
- Highly recommend the Guarantor to seek independent legal and financial advice from an independent third party (i.e. not the borrower’s representative/s).
- For Property Share applications, advise the Guarantor that it is mandatory for Guarantors to seek independent legal advice
- Explain that the Guarantor may refuse to sign the guarantee or withdraw by providing written notice at any time before funding
- Explain that the guarantor has the right to limit their liability in accordance with BCoP and as allowed by law
- Explain that the guarantor can request information about the transaction or loan to be guaranteed, and if applicable, the guarantee might cover future credit facilities and variations of the existing loan.

2.
Explain that the Guarantee is for the life of the loan, or if they wish to be discharged earlier, it is subject to bank assessment, which will require the borrower’s consent as well

Note:

- During the interview, you must consider if the Guarantor is suitable for the loan and if they should be required to seek independent legal advice before signing the Guarantee (see ’13. Guarantor Suitability’ and ‘14. Independent Legal Advice’ below for further guidance)
- If the guarantor is over the age of 61, you MUST discuss their retirement plan and exit strategy and record notes about this in your submission. You must explain to the guarantor that the guarantee may impact their future pension or retirement outcomes and you must confirm that they have considered these impacts.
- If the Guarantor does not wish to obtain independent legal and/or financial advice, confirm why and assess whether legal advice is required or if you are comfortable that the Guarantor understands the risks. You are required to leave notes in the application confirming this.

Next steps:

After the interview, you will be required to leave interview notes in the application comments and answer the following questions:

- Why do you deem the Guarantor/s suitable?
- Were there any concerns and/or vulnerability indicators identified? If YES – provide details and explain why you are comfortable they are acceptable as Guarantor/s?
- Were there any other unique circumstances identified (i.e., personal / financial)?
- Will the Guarantor/s be seeking legal and financial advice? If NO – explain why you are comfortable they understand the risks?
- For each Guarantor 61+ years of age, what is their retirement plan and/or exit strategy?

3. If you have identified the Guarantor/s are using their Owner-Occupied home as security and/or is receiving government assistance or aged pension as their sole income – explain how they meet exception criteria?

Refer to ‘12. Interview Comment Examples’ for further guidance and examples on how to leave comprehensive interview comments

You will also be required to complete an attestation in the Guarantor Declarations section in Apply Online to confirm that interview procedure has been followed

Note:

The Guarantor’s sole source of income cannot be a Government pension or payment when they are using their principal place of residence as security with the exception of: where the principal place of residence being used as security is already owned jointly with the borrower; or where in the case of joint security guarantors one of the guarantor’s sole source of income is not a Government pension or payment.

# Interview Comments - Examples

https://www.commbroker.com.au/Net/Documentum/products/home-loan-products/borrowing-options/guarantors-support.aspx

# CommBroker-Products

See below examples of Guarantor Interview Comments which would be considered acceptable, not acceptable, or considered "too much" information. The below references are a guide only, interview comments should be in your own words and reflect your assessment of the Guarantor’s suitability and circumstances as assessed during the interview.

# Acceptable Examples (guide only, do not copy and paste)

|Acceptable Examples (guide only, do not copy and paste)|Non-compliant examples:|Too much information – Example (information highlighted below is already covered in the Guarantor Declaration / not relevant or not appropriate)|
|---|---|---|
|Example 1 (Family Security Support):|Example 1|No notes left|
|Why do I deem the Guarantor/s as suitable? Jane and Thomas are suitable guarantors as they mentioned they have been guarantors before and understand the associated risks and confirm they want to proceed to help their daughter, Mary. Why do I still view the Guarantor/s as suitable despite Owner-Occupied home and government assistance? The security property being provided is the Guarantors owner occupied property and Jane receives a government pension. The reason why I still deem them as suitable guarantors is because Thomas is still working and does not receive a government pension. Legal and financial advice? Guarantor/s will not be receiving legal or financial advice as they are comfortable that they understand the risks and they have been guarantors before. Exit strategy / retirement plan? Guarantors are over 61+ so exit strategy and retirement plan was discussed, Guarantor/s have a detailed plan with multiple unencumbered properties that they plan to sell in the future. Any other unique circumstances? Guarantor/s mentioned that they might be interested in purchasing another property in the future. They are aware that being a guarantor may impact their ability to apply for lending in their own name/s and were still comfortable to proceed. Concerns or vulnerabilities? No concerns or vulnerability identified by myself.|Example 2|Questions are answered with simple Yes/No|
