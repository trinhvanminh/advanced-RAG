There is no need to use Government pensions and payments when servicing can be satisfactorily demonstrated from the customer's other income.

Government payments should only be considered as a supplementary income source for the application where the main stream of income is derived from another source.

Comments:

- Where Government payments are the only source of income, the application can be considered on a case by case basis (does not apply to pensions).
- All other Centrelink payments, including rent assistance, are unacceptable forms of income.
- Newstart is an excluded income and will not be considered.
- Borrowers must be entitled to receive family tax benefit (part A and B) for the next 3 years.

NOTE: Rent assistance is not an ongoing payment or income source, therefore should not be used for calculating serviceability.

# Verification

Use the following only:

- Letter from Centrelink or relevant government body confirming benefit amount, less than 6 weeks old immediately preceding the date of application - 90%.
- Letter must be downloaded by the customer from the My Gov website.

Comments:

- The Government payments must be entered into the 'tax free' field of the application.
- The Pension income should be entered into the 'pension' field of the application, unless it has been confirmed as 'tax free' (evidence of tax-free pension to be imaged).
- For information on Centrelink payments refer to the Centrelink Website.
