Eligible Income

Simple Verification Self-Employed Income

Self-employed customers derive their income from their own business. They earn income and pay out business expenses during the year, with the difference between their income and expenses being their profit or loss. The simple verification method can be used to extract self-employed income paid to the borrower from their individual tax returns or where the customer is paying themselves a regular salary for a minimum period of 6 months using payslips or salary credits. Note, retained profit from the Business and addbacks cannot be used for servicing when using this method.

A minimum of 2 years trading history must be confirmed. If they have not been trading for 2 years, individual circumstances can be considered by a PCAA holder if the application is deemed creditworthy.

The 'Full verification' method must be used to verify self-employed income where additional income from the business is required to demonstrate servicing. Full and simple verification is not applicable for salaried or eligible equity1 partners in Law, Accounting and/or Consulting Firms. Refer to the “Law, Accounting and / or Consulting Firm Partner Income” policy listed under ‘PAYG Salary/Wage’ in the IVT. All other equity partners are to be verified using the self-employed full or simple verification methods.

Verification Method Calculations

Calculate the average by totaling the six months’ salary credits and dividing by the number of pay periods to obtain the average net income amount. Enter this amount in the net to gross calculator and use the calculated annual gross income amount in the application.

Option 1

Where the salary being paid into the customer’s account is a gross figure then annualize this figure and input this figure.

Note: Do not use the net to gross income calculator

Note: The salary credits may be varied in the amount and actual day that it is paid, provided the pay period is clear and the frequency of the salary credits remains consistent over the required period.

Income is to be extracted from the Individual Tax Return as per the Simple Verification Process Guide.

Option 2

Refer: Simple verification - Process Guide and Individual Tax Return examples

Option 3

Annualize the YTD amount from the payslip. Note: Where the customer commenced payment of regular salary/wages after 1 July of the current financial year confirm and evidence the start date
