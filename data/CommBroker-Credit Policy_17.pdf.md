# Eligible Income

Seasonal Income

Seasonal employees typically receive their income over a particular period or part of the year (e.g. a fruit picker who only works three months of the year, or a fisherman who earns income in the fishing season covering nine months of the year) as opposed to receiving income over a full year.

# Restrictions

Income is not to be annualised and the actual income received over the season used for servicing.

This verification standard can only be used by customers who have worked for more than one season in the same industry or employment role.

# Verification

- Letter from employer or employment agency detailing:
- Current employment arrangement confirming number of months per year they work
- Length of employment
- Gross salary for the period
- Most recent payslip (may be older than 6 weeks if season has ended)
- PAYG payment summary/’Tax ready’ Income Statement or Tax return.

Notes:

- The payslip is to be used to verify income is being received as stated on the letter.
- Where the customer has more than one seasonal employer / employment agency you must obtain the above for each.

# Calculations

Use the lower of the amount/s stated on the letter/s and the PAYG payment summary/’Tax ready’ Income Statement/s or Tax return.

Notes:

- For cases where overtime is noted and the employment type has been confirmed as seasonal, it is not necessary to calculate overtime separately as is done for a permanent employee who has set hours of work.
- Input the calculated seasonal income in the application.
